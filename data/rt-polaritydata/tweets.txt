1000	1000	1	@stacymadern thats the prob with Zyprexa its for ppl with Bi-Polar or Schizophrenia its really strong when you wake up your drowsy for 6 hrs
1000	1000	1	@stark3923 cipro has a known warning of weakening the Achilles tendon. ...
1000	1000	1	Screw you Paxil! You do wonders for anxiety but you make me a ultra lightweight
1000	1000	1	Also, yay addiction. It's drugs i need for living, but it's still dependance. every time i get a "paxil headache" i realize this. oh well.
1000	1000	1	Wondered why my limbs ached and I was shivering on the hottest day of the year so far. Forgot my venlafaxine. That'll be withdrawal then!
1000	1000	1	I am way too hyper to go home and do nothing tonight :( damn Prozac >.<
1000	1000	1	Rivaroxaban 2/2 lower back pain. Not very PC but am crippled by this drug. Taking more paracetamols. Must ring for 'phone consultation.
1000	1000	1	That nap was on point.... Cymbalta did that shit cuz I dont take naps...ever
1000	1000	1	I wish I could be tired. Shouldn't have taken the vyvanse. Now I'm never sleeping.
1000	1000	1	@Jakefletcha @Becki_65roses Cipro is real bad on your entire body! Take it from me (on disability since '09 thanks to just 12 pills).
1000	1000	1	I'd rather be on the Effexor that made me happy though I had severe back pain from it.. Than sad and crying for no reason on lexapro....
1000	1000	1	Question time #crohns #ibd #humira does anyone suffer from egg burps? What works for you
1000	1000	1	19.32 day 20 Rivaroxaban diary. Still residual aches and pains; only had 4 paracetamol today.
1000	1000	1	why do I not remember going to bed or waking up (the answer: probably seroquel)
1000	1000	1	Only one day in and Mirtazapine is like fluoxetine all over again, it just makes me so tiered
1000	1000	1	Just about dead, think it's bedtime.. Fuck you quetiapine
1000	1000	1	The day after Humira used to be a great one, full of energy, low pain. After a month, it is now a fatigue filled achy day. #rheum
1000	1000	1	Day has been a right off. Missed opticians&slept aw day. Sitting here torn faced, wi greasy hair&unwashed. Swollen feet thx to olanzapine.
1000	1000	1	@JessBarrett227 Taking someone off 150mg off Seroquel, mixing it with Olanzapine in 2 wks causes psychosis - a proper assess was not done.
1000	1000	1	@BLEDNOS Lamictal and trileptal and seroquel...of course the seroquel I take in severe situations because gaining weight is never cool
1000	1000	1	@HDAwareness cause UCD sayed I had Huntington's disease for like 8 yrs, then said high dose zyprexa caused a false diagnosis. I think I have
1000	1000	1	@Joanne__Howe enbrel is a miracle but it made my eyes worse :( so couldn't have it anymore :(
1000	1000	1	@brain_opera I had to taper myself down. I think the Seroquel gave me lasting sleep paralysis. I've had it ever since.
1000	1000	1	Actually it was more like a prison but with nurses instead of guards, olanzapine pill n IM= #zombies
1000	1000	1	@drdrew I recently stopped taking effexor 225 what can i do to ease my withdrawls?I feel miserable right now and very angry.Please any ideas
1000	1000	1	What to do? Not looking forward to cold turkey withdrawals from Pristiq... sense of impending doom. Anxiety only makes the situation worse.
1000	1000	1	Rivaroxaban diary ctd , neck and should ache, lower back pain and knee ache.
1000	1000	1	@david82wilkins @CFAware Neither of you appear to be aware that Cipro can cripple otherwise healthy people...doctor fail to mention that?
1000	1000	1	Pt of mine died from Cipro RT @CIPROisPOISON: @gastromom If only more doctors thought like you! I lost my entire life to 12 Cipro pills
1000	1000	1	I'm loosing so much blood right now. Humira is some scurry ish.
1000	1000	1	Getting a seven page text of garbled ramblings from someone detailing that their titrating of venlafaxine led to a break up is unusual.
1000	1000	1	Anyone who will listen: never ever take Effexor/Venlafaxine. Paraesthesia abound.
1000	1000	1	Just wondering where the side effect of hating the world is stated on vyvanse advertisements?
1000	1000	1	venlafaxine makes me feel so nauseas hahahaha oh god I'm going to chunder in my geography lesson help
1000	1000	1	Toothache. Discovered that somewhere in the paracetamol, codeine, sertraline #quetiapine combination there is a bad mix. #hallucinating
1000	1000	1	@PosAware my t cell went up w ith humira I also have crohns disease. I wish u guys had more articles with people like me in it
1000	1000	1	Oh, and I forgot that with Lamotrigine come awful night terrors. I woke up no fewer than five times screaming and sweaty. #lol
1000	1000	1	@SpicyNyx fluoxetine and quet combo zombified me...ah, the meds merrygoround #bipolar
1000	1000	1	Hmm, interesting. I may have been undergoing Baclofen withdrawal hence the anxiety for the past few months… #hypochondria
1000	1000	1	@illtreaturite1 Fluox a friend 4 years, but switch to cymbalta 4 anti-depress/pain control. I OCD worry. Can't stop running mind
1000	1000	1	@fragileannie @meilufay I tried Baclofen, another common muscle relaxer, and had too many side-effects from it, including worsening pain.
1000	1000	1	@skernandez because I realized Vyvanse after a certain time of taking it increased my anxiety and made me more irrational.
1000	1000	1	@neomoms I had been blaming my dizziness upon standing to my menopause but now on HRT & no more flashes so looked at cymbalta side effs
1000	1000	1	So I may be allergic to the metoprolol. Rash on my face. Needing my inhaler daily since Friday.
1000	1000	1	@Glass1ncision -nods- My zombie-ness when I first wake up in the morning is mostly from my nightly meds too (Seroquel).
1000	1000	1	Do not ever get on Cymbalta. Getting off of it is HELL!
1000	1000	1	I suggest never stop taking Effexor abruptly because you will feel like you're on your death bed
1000	1000	1	I resent taking olanzapine as it is the side effects of olanzapine that were mistaken for negative symptoms of schizophrenia
1000	1000	1	@nicoleccoelho I take fluoxetine and it doesn't do shit it just makes me dizzy and tired
1000	1000	1	My vyvanse is seriously about to drive me crazy
1000	1000	1	Almost vomited on a zinc lozenge #yuk
1000	1000	1	can't sleep, but i'm afraid that the muscle tremors keep me awake even worse if i take promethazine in combination with fluoxetine...
1000	1000	1	People taking #quetiapine - does this need to sleep 24/7 go eventually? Cos this is not sustainable beyond the short term.
1000	1000	1	@weswroten @bullfrogr wow Paxil sent me into a huge hypo manic mixed episode.
1000	1000	1	Lamotrigine causing steven johnson syndrome
1000	1000	1	This Vyvanse got me sweating right now and I dont even know why
1000	1000	1	@Shellyfanelly I was on #azathioprine for about 8 years, it worked well, now on #Humira instead though which is knocking me about
1000	1000	1	@sapphire20 to it, and now I'm on Humira with just the bloat to battle. Things sometimes get super shitty in every sense. But stay strong xx
1000	1000	1	@brokenmind_ Quetiapine was horrific for me in relation to wait gain. Such a horror story. But the weight will come off one day at a time.
1000	1000	1	No one likes me on my Vyvanse #TooChill #Zombiemode
1000	1000	1	@neurobonkers also, "meth mouth" is really poverty mouth. u don't c when people take it for ADHD. nor in Prozac, which similarly dries mouth
1000	1000	1	"...but then Staph is all like 'I'll just mutate my gyrase gene,' and suddenly everyone's *shocked* it's Levaquin resistant! Psh." #OHonID
1000	1000	1	This night of no sleep is brought to you by Vyvanse.
1000	1000	1	Woke up to breakfast in bed...well couch because I'm addicted to the new 3D wifi tv. Too bad I have no appetite. Thanks Cymbalta.
1000	1000	1	@JameeTMiller I didn't have side effects when I started taking Cymbalta. After about 6 mths had to stop because it raised my blood pressure.
1000	1000	1	Little did I know that I would go through withdrawals when coming off of Effexor XR. #antidepressants
1000	1000	1	I can't secretly try and come off my olanzapine as my CPN and psychiatrist will notice the weight loss!
1000	1000	1	@Glinda_R @SpooniesCouch Cymbalta withdrawal is getting top billing at the moment, however. Ugh! xx
1000	1000	1	I've been on Paxil for 10 years for depression/anxiety and at first it used to help but I guess I've built up tolerance and I come too fast.
1000	1000	1	@teepeewest Did you get floxed too? I've been in bed since 2009 thanks to just 12 Cipro pills! They never told me this can be permanent!!!
1000	1000	1	@joshuagates You forgot the immodium for when the Cipro kills all the good bacteria. :) #travelskills
1000	1000	1	Owww. I hurt my foot. & am concerned. 1st warning on Cipro is tendon damage. :-/ It certainly wasn't a rupture. I'm sure I'm just paranoid.
1000	1000	1	@Justjeffpls Seroquel can cause high blood sugars, talk to your Dr. exercise everyday. Lose weight. If U have type 1, ask someone else
1000	1000	1	SO IT FUCKING TURNS OUT THAT A SIDE EFFECT OF EFFEXOR IS A LOSS OF APPETITE
1000	1000	1	@anwen @Ellwynnnnn Venlafaxine withdrawal is worse than most by miles x
1000	1000	1	@gastromom WOW...if only more doctors thought like you!! I lost my entire life to twelve Cipro pills.
1000	1000	1	Rivaroxaban diary day 22. Last tablet taken Tuesday 18th, 4 days ago. Woken up in pain. Bad fluid retention (uneven) on both legs.
1000	1000	1	I have got to stop taking my Vyvanse so late!! #nosleep #addproblems
1000	1000	1	@cheer_bear13 @LithiumLibGirl I couldn't take lamictal 1 week into it I got the rash.a rush trip to the ER.6 months till rash was gone.
1000	1000	1	@McMorag my dreams became vivider I think with Effexor #BPDChat
1000	1000	1	The Seroquel the doc gave me, makes doing things difficult. . . But if I don't do something, I'll fall asleep. The catch-22 of crazy.
1000	1000	1	So I ran out of Victoza before payday & restarted it yesterday. Bleh: nausea. It did help me lose @ 10 lbs. but I found 3 when I ran out.
1000	1000	1	Trazodone is no joke. Slept through every alarm.
1000	1000	1	All nighter is killing me right now, I hate you vyvanse
1000	1000	1	Wide awake and this trazodone starting to feel like a sugar pill.. I'd actually prefer to be at work right bout now.
1000	1000	1	@KarimS3D Olanzapine actually makes you put on weight, even when you aren't eating that much
1000	1000	1	Anyway, I was just feeling itchy and my neck was red so they gave me benedryl with my #tysabri. Might be a coincidence but just in case
1000	1000	1	Weird thing about paxil: feeling fully awake and energized and feeling completely tired and half-asleep at the same time.
1000	1000	1	That Seroquel has been given me some seriously fucked up dreams.
1000	1000	1	@ajswurld I'm allergic to Enbrel :-( bad reaction
1000	1000	1	@PArthritis I don't know that one, but metho made me sick everyday I took it. I had to stop. Enbrel has worked wonders for me .. so far
1000	1000	1	But I don't want to take an ambien or trazodone or anything because i dint wanna restart my dependence upon them
1000	1000	1	@RealHausfrau @Tantalizinyou my step-dad was on Effexer,taking supplements for energy and drinking like a fish when he shot my daughter&me

1000	1000	1	my sim card isn't working aaggh i feel like im having cymbalta withdrawal again aaagh aaaggh
1000	1000	1	“@vyvanseswag: I run on Vyvanse and RedBull.” So done with that life. Vyvance cooked my brain like a stove top
1000	1000	1	just wondering why doctors prescribe dangerous, addictive medications without any warning to patients. Paxil, for instance.
1000	1000	1	@NeelieB @DavidJuurlink @US_FDA hot flashes won't be around forever; but weaning of paroxetine could be a nightmare
1000	1000	1	ugh I wish my vyvanse didn't make my stomach hurt so bad
1000	1000	1	#effexor #withdrawl is a monster that i have taken by the horns and am wrestling to the ground...this time i am winning! 7thdayfree
1000	1000	1	Dabigatran not working in this obese pt, maybe contributing to his stroke. Saved by tPA.... Speechlesshttp://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1215900?af=R&rss=currentIssue&utm_source=feedly …
1000	1000	1	God humira shots blow so bad... #painful #crohnssucks
1000	1000	1	Question: anyone on #humira experiencing urinary track infections frequently and never had before?
1000	1000	1	@lucilleparr I take quetiapine and it's supposed to just relax me I end up falling asleep within 2 hours. My brain's always scattered haha
1000	1000	1	whoa quetiapine stop making me feel drowsy yo
1000	1000	1	So unfair, I never get the good side effects of meds. Ativan, Seroquel, & Ambien XR make me feel so drink I cant really walk & Im nauseated
1000	1000	1	Half awake and po'd! 60mg of baclofen and 14mg of valium.... legs still spasmed too much to get tatted. I hatechyu legs!
1000	1000	1	This seroquel got me lo0o0py as helll. This status took me at least thirty minutes to type I keep waking up without knowing I feel asleep
1000	1000	1	@duncantrussell I watched that movie "Side Effects" while coming off Paxil and relapsed
1000	1000	1	Panic attacking because you cant find your Effexor and know withdrawal will set in momentarily <<<<<<<.
1000	1000	1	Tysabri infusion #54 yesterday. Made me feel tired and out of it for a while. Maybe it's the heat - 34C (94F)!!! Maybe a VERY HOT summer?
1000	1000	1	Is it hot in here or is my Vyvanse just kicking in?
1000	1000	1	Took a vyvanse for the first time in a month feelin weird.
1000	1000	1	3 red bulls, 2 vyvanse, no sleep = shit feeling
1000	1000	1	DOC for Panic disorders: alprazolam (addictive) and paroxetine (sedating). #psychiatry
1000	1000	1	been taking low dosage of paroxetine for the last two years and only recently found out that a common side affect is pinsandneedles.
1000	1000	1	01.10 day 13 rivaroxaban diary. Headache over right side of head; lower back pain. Wrote letter to my GP & his colleague outlining problems
1000	1000	1	@catch_n_reLISE Not sure what antibiotic that was in the pic (maybe Bactrim??), but dairy products reduce the efficacy of ciprofloxacin
1000	1000	1	@MTV When are you going to do True Life: I am addicted to Vyvanse?
1000	1000	1	@adelerosenbloom Getting off Seroquel (Sero-KILL) can cause convulsions, fever, toxic reactions, psychotic reactions. and other shit
1000	1000	1	can't even enjoy this banana right now because of fuckin vyvanse what is life
1000	1000	1	@catthoma Right, some SSRIs are used for cataplexy, as is Effexor. Can be tricky to wean off without rebound. #nchat
1000	1000	1	@juntei My old ones took 2 days for withdrawals but Effexor which I'm on now I will get them the next day :/ I wish I could email you valium
1000	1000	1	@johncheese I hated effexor. It makes you hungry, dizzy, and lethargic. That culminated in a large weight gain for me.
1000	1000	1	@ShipMom Cipro is awful makes me sick as a dog too
1000	1000	1	Well my effexor kinda did its job to keep my anxiety under control.... but now to get my heart rate down..... ugh
1000	1000	1	#bpdchat I take seroquel at night, high dose. It knocks me out
1000	1000	1	@PArthritis I don't know that one, but metho made me sick everyday I took it. I had to stop. Enbrel has worked wonders for me .. so far
1000	1000	1	@tittuck i know it made me want to be sick every time i had it plus fluoxetine is the bigges bunch of shit ive been on worse than sertraline
1000	1000	1	In need of a dream interpreter.. #quetiapine is really having an affect on my night visions.. Some fucked up scenarios in my sleep LOL :-/
1000	1000	1	@IntegrateMD I sure wish my doctor had told me Cipro could disable me for life! There was never any mention of that. Now I'm crippled.
1000	1000	1	vyvanse makes me think too much
1000	1000	1	So damn sleepy. This seroquel is fucking me up so bad.
1000	1000	1	08.15 day 13 Rivaroxaban diary. Lower back ache, neck ache, hips and knees ache, short of breath, (am asthmatic) taken 2paracetamol, to bed.
1000	1000	1	I hate my new medication. It makes me feel hungry :-( #quetiapine
1000	1000	1	21.36 day 9 Rivaroxaban diary. Particularly bad lower back ache had not eased by 14.00 so went to bed. Much better when I woke at 19.00.
1000	1000	1	@inarticulate I haven't had an orgasm in a long time.. Wtf.. #paxil
1000	1000	1	The drugs don't work!!! From fit to hobbling in a few days. Off the pills but may need wks to recover & be prone to ruptures #ciprofloxacin
1000	1000	1	@gastromom The only pt of mine who ever died was one age 21 profound autism chronic underwt & GI issues, given lots of Cipro. Terrible
1000	1000	1	Personal frustration med's that work (Humira) then wear-off even when taking MTX for anti-bodies. #rheum
1000	1000	1	@OUCH_UK didnt know Lamotrigine was addictive Stopped as didnt think were helping @clusterheads 3 days of hell before realized, back on now
1000	1000	1	Rivaroxaban diary day 22. Am beginning to think all pains from pressure on that part of body are due to fluid retention.
1000	1000	1	Has anyone tried the humira shot, I heard it feels like hot lava going thru your skin for the first seconds but my doctor wants me to get it
1000	1000	1	@upasbook Great read as always. I was on Cymbalta for 5 days. Cold turkey had sweats, migraine, tremors while on & 3 days after.
1000	1000	1	Tell you okes what: When your Dr. says only take Seroquel at night, only take it at night. Zombiness galore.
1000	1000	1	@guccigreenery i felt drugged on Ritalin. i love vyvanse. i can't tell i'm on it except for feeling better and calmer and more structured
1000	1000	1	Thank God it is finally get cooler in London. I have been melting all day! I wonder if my medication reduces my tolerance to heat? #Seroquel
1000	1000	1	@annaspargoryan benzos don't work for me & I've had a cracker of a panic attack on seroquel. listening to people chat on podcasts helps me.
1000	1000	1	I need more medication than this.My body is already building a tolerance for the Prozac I've been taking.
1000	1000	1	Stopped #seroquel for 2 months as it caused terrible side effect. Had to start back up or lose my job #hotflashes r soooo fun #thisismylife
1000	1000	1	@foggymelon @movmctov @The_Scottymomma when I did Humira for my Crohn's it felt like acid, hubby had to shoot me up. Made my lupus flare too
1000	1000	1	@SonnieDetore I cannot be in the sun! #levaquin
1000	1000	1	Why seroquel can make me put on 20 over kg: it acts like an insulin blocker or something.
1000	1000	1	My body is so not ready for this seroquel. Never had an antidepressant knock me the fuck out at a quarter dose before o _o
1000	1000	1	I guess this is what I get for doubling my vyvanse #nosleep
1000	1000	1	Oh. Delayed reaction from Humira injections-my hip joints just started hurting. Haha.
1000	1000	1	@MondaysMomma It's ok, I guess it's just a case of trial and error with antidepressants. Coming off venlafaxine has been so nasty :(
1000	1000	1	vyvanse makes me think too much
1000	1000	1	@sarahchoueiry @crohns_twins i also have nuasea and low grade temp and on #humira should i go check it out??
1000	1000	1	@jessindia I take fluoxetine and quetiapine. The quetiapine is the one with the massive sleepies, althouth the flouxetine doesn''t help.
1000	1000	1	@Chavielle i has beta blockers now, apparently the fluoxetine can cause panic attacks ^_^
1000	1000	1	@boatsnkrose They are on to you. Poppin' metoprolol and she sweatin'.
1000	1000	1	The cymbalta certainly is addictive & its FDA approved...
1000	1000	1	@ElectroSocket I was on enbrel for 8 years have since developed neuro problems (ataxia) wish id never taken it side effects not worth risks
1000	1000	1	@BipolarBlogger yeah, generic Venlafaxine has about four different slow release formulations, I got withdrawals from some.
1000	1000	1	@DoctorMcPA Had my doctor attempted to treat with bactrim prior to Cipro, I wouldn't be crippled today.
1000	1000	1	olanzapine is supposed to make you a fat bastard i got off lucky. lithium makes my hand shake. bipolar or schizo drugs.
1000	1000	1	Just had a marathon sleep past 24hrs on new dose of #duloxetine -hope my liver will be ok on it.Woke with stressy tummy pains. #sideeffects
1000	1000	1	I'm so irritable when my vyvanse wears off #fuckkk
1000	1000	1	@elladeruiter oh I hate that! I used to be on citalopram, it stopped working eventually. sometimes I have to up my effexor dose temporarily.
1000	1000	1	@Poet_Carl_Watts @Yueesei ... used to be on them #justaddanother ...worst was the psychotic episode when starting #paxil but one of my favs
1000	1000	1	@AaronM effexor was a boner killer, absolutely. welbutrin goes the other way.
1000	1000	1	@Nichole_Lindsey I've had Cipro before. Luckily for me, the only side fx I tend to get from AB is gastic upset. But I RARELY use AB.
1000	1000	1	@theotherrift can also get "extrapyramidal symptoms" ie tremor from olanzapine.
1000	1000	1	@rickywarwick So true Ricky! I went into anaphylactic shock & almost died from taking Cipro! Dangerous drug - be careful!! Take care.
1000	1000	1	@calyxxx same with venlafaxine, 1 user I spoke to yrs ago stopped taking that when she started having acid like trips losing hours at a time
1000	1000	1	Throbbing headache from not having my pills. 2 pills left I need to save. This sucks :( #paroxetine #socialanxiety
1000	1000	1	Day five of no effexor. I am guessing this is what it feels like when you come off heroin... #discontinuation
1000	1000	1	This Lamictal shit ain't cuttin the mustard; any "mood stabilizers" that don't steal your soul & make u a bloated zombie a la Britney?
1000	1000	1	the come down on vyvanse kicks my ass every time
1000	1000	1	@benderbach cause humira gives me a lot of rashes and like most of these drugs.. Skin sensitivity happens
1000	1000	1	Developing ADD in my 20s thanks to the memory/attention-killing lamictal I've been on since my early teens. #bipolar #morepillsmoreproblems
1000	1000	1	@Clarketacular Fanapt was the only thing that calmed her rages but comes with tremors. I'm so sorry :(
1000	1000	1	Upped my Effexor dosage 5 days ago. Sleep cycle and quality went to shit 4 days ago. I sense a correlation here...
1000	1000	1	@ElizabethAF not addictive? 'SSRI discontinuation syndrome.' I know someone who has been trying to come off venlafaxine for over two years >
1000	1000	1	vyvanse makes me think too much
1000	1000	1	I might have gained 30 lbs in 6 weeks on Zyprexa...Haven't lost that weight yet, and it's been 12 years now. Call doc if it happens to you.
1000	1000	1	@crescentcolours that'll be the quetiapine making you drowsy. It's a common side effect xx
1000	1000	1	I LOVE this Effexor! MAJORLY kills my libido.
1000	1000	1	@hello_nacho @tobiasampersand I'm with you. Even though the Pristiq works, I still don't feel fully human.
1000	1000	1	@Fatuglyew thing about venlafaxine is the withdrawals when you're late for a dose - it's like electric shocks in your brain, and they go -
1000	1000	1	@missynomatter i was on quetiapine and gained 40lbs <wall> so i am not even trying olanzapine. they gave me abilify cause it not supposed to
1000	1000	1	Ready for bed but vyvanse is saying no #forciblynocturnal

1000	1000	1	Oh man! I've been a total quetiapine zombie all morning! I've been taking them for years but every now + then they really mess me up!
1000	1000	1	So my body was goin threw withdrawl? Lol didnt kno Paxil was that strong lol
1000	1000	1	My 3 favourite things about fluoxetine are: It doesnt work as an antidepressant. Increases suicidal thoughts. It stops you from jizzing.
1000	1000	1	Does anyone happen to know if Lamictal causes you to feel hot? @liberonetwork @_Sabiiiiii #cantstopsweating
1000	1000	1	Lamictal dosage increases kind of wreck my head for a day or two. But they also make me super productive as long as I can do things slowly.
1000	1000	1	@almostwell yeh same bk felt like sumo wrestler on it all time :( think its f****ed me 4life :( ironic as Humira is used to treat artheritis
1000	1000	1	That seroquel had me sleepy as fuck alllll damn day
1000	1000	1	So apparently 60mgs of Prozac will make you scared of eating GMO's and make you think you need to save the world! Switching back to 40mgs!!!
1000	1000	1	@HurtBlogger good luck! Have you tried it before? Does it work 4 u? I just had 2nd dose of Humira, and hurting so bad I can't stand it :-(
1000	1000	1	Anemia, hormones, depression & Paxil are totally getting the best of me this morning. Getting out of bed is haaard.
1000	1000	1	@CrohnieCharlie #Humira helped my #Crohns but then #Respiratory issues ensued & now I can't take ANYTHING & have MAJOR lung issues
1000	1000	1	@DoctorChristian @C4Dispatch re victoza I was prescribed this in 2010 for obesity. Caused pancreatitis and digestive problems ever since
1000	1000	1	"No taste for you" -vyvanse
1000	1000	1	@Sombrera The only medication (of which I am aware...and I know almost all of them) that has a regular headache side-effect is lamictal.
1000	1000	1	@zmiller1902 Sometimes my Humira pens make me feel like I'm 90 years old due to the joint pain everywhere.
1000	1000	1	Restless arms & legs! Blood quetiapine :-/
1000	1000	1	I think my tablets have made me gain weight. Anyone on fluoxetine/prozac? #replytweet

1000	1000	1	This new baccy is just making my cough so much worse but ahhh well need my nicotine
1000	1000	1	Gimme one reason why I shouldn't have sex drive / libido. I accept this as a part of withdrawal symptoms from Venlafaxine. :O
1000	1000	1	@chenoite @CSB_22 yes def eat or the cipro will tear u up and feel better :-)
1000	1000	1	It's raining. I ran for the bus when I didn't need to. My GP letter isn't right. Sweating like a pig thanks to quetiapine. Brighton bound!
1000	1000	1	@DeanMikel I'm not lazy!! My seroquel knocked me out!!
1000	1000	1	@ObsidianVormund Was on Seroquel for years in my teens & stopped taking it. A 'quack' doc put me back on it & I gained 50 in 3 months.
1000	1000	1	@badboyfloyd_ lmao, i'm prescribed baby. it's for my anxiety. i take seroquel, and celexa with it. i'm a fucking zombie after 9pm.
1000	1000	1	Took a percocet for my tooth. Feel like I'm about to die cause of the Prozac thats already in my system. Apparently you can't take both. FML
1000	1000	1	I have a life appointment tomorrow, and I'm going to cry to her about lamictal. Because it makes everything worse. I hate medication.
1000	1000	1	Fuckin wired! Not sleeping tonight. #Vyvanse #WhatDoIDo #Yuuuuup
1000	1000	1	@Derbyshirecc #carersweek Still no reply. Still cut off and isolated...on Duloxetine and sick but still forced to care...well done!
1000	1000	1	Sleeping my life away on #quetiapine. Fine by me.
1000	1000	1	"How do u do it? U got me losing every breath. What did u give me to make my heart beat out my chest?" #vyvanse
1000	1000	1	@jessielee122 You can say that again! I trusted my doc and ended up crippled thanks to just 12 Cipro pills. Going on 4 years now.
1000	1000	1	Quetiapine - I slept!! Weirdo dreams and very drowsy this morning but I slept!!!
1000	1000	1	@lynnbett Off Venlafaxine which was pure hell for me, I can't switch these meds anymore, tired of feeling like shit all day.
1000	1000	1	Did you know insanely intense dreams are a known side effect of venlafaxine? It's not an antidepressant, it's my Dream Fuel!
1000	1000	1	I am never taking baclofen and norflex the same day again. First I felt super drowsy but now I feel extremely high and it's freaking me out.
1000	1000	1	@lisabinkc @trainingwithra @dsymons Enbrel also available as prefilled syringe, much gentler. Pen leaves bruises! #rheum
1000	1000	1	The #Quetiapine is kicking in. Bizarre thoughts tonight. Tempted to take the whole lot. I won't - don't worry people. Just odd thoughts.
1000	1000	1	@aDreamItsTrue things like mirtazipine&trazodone weight gain isn't too hard to mitigate.Things like valproate substantially more of an issue
1000	1000	1	I DON'T WANT TO TAKE MY HUMIRA AT ALL THE PAIN IS ALWAYS UNBEARABLE AND I DON'T WANNA
1000	1000	1	@jessovenden No more SSRI’s for me. They kept giving me manic reactions, usually angry. The Seroquel has me feeling too tired. It’s brutal
1000	1000	1	Seriously if you are getting off cymbalta tape alot if movies I was up till 4 and feel and look like a zombie just to tired to growl !!!
1000	1000	1	Vyvanse is really taking its toll now #headache #anger
1000	1000	1	Brisdelle dangerous. Paxil is supposed to treat depression and suicidal thoughts. I took Paxil and got depressed. Went off & OK in 2 wk.
1000	1000	1	fluoxetine makes me see shapes when i close my eyes
1000	1000	1	#tysabri really takes it out on me. Spent most of the day sleeping.
1000	1000	1	today is the day for my biweekly humira injection, any volunteers to take it for me? It hurts.
1000	1000	1	out of pills, feeling like a train wreck #tweaking #effexor
1000	1000	1	I ate 2 cakes + 2 pastries at work today. Blaming the quetiapine rather than my liking for cakes. Blaming work too for providing free cake.
1000	1000	1	Depression hurts Cymbalta can... fuck your whole body up inside out so your rainy day doesn't seem so bad... pussy.
1000	1000	1	THIS PAXIL MAKES ME PEE SO OFTEN OMG #SorryNotSorry
1000	1000	1	06.30 day 14 Rivaroxaban diary. Thanks to paracetamol and hot water bottle I had 4 hrs continuous sleep. Woke uo with frontal headache, 1/2
1000	1000	1	I'm now back on the olanzapine along side lithium. Ugh. #helloweightgain
1000	1000	1	i have been on lorazepam / diazepam / quetiapine for the past few nights and i've noticed i am slightly drooling a bit. lovely.
1000	1000	1	The placebo week of birth control increases blood levels of Lamictal, which in turn makes me a very cheerful insomniac.
1000	1000	1	@HarryDFish @deltrimental Joe is on Pristiq and he gets weird brain zap / twitch things too.
1000	1000	1	He said he is 'slowly dying of starvation'. I don't want to be the one to say stop taking the Aricept and Namenda...
1000	1000	1	@ftamalenus I keep telling myself 8 am, but I think the Trazodone fucks it up. :( It knocks me right out and won't let me wake up.
1000	1000	1	@_RubyRouge_ I'm reducing duloxitine (been on 6 yr) and slowly increasing M but slept 13-14 hrs solid and still feel wasted
1000	1000	1	this seroquel-dry-mouth thing is getting weird
1000	1000	1	@PreciousThing I just had a look buddy, and my medication (Seroquel) does affect tolerance to the sun.
1000	1000	1	@Back_datASHup same lol didn't eat a thing, damn vyvanse
1000	1000	1	This rant could be #paxil withdrawl...or delayed divorce rage.
1000	1000	1	Morning fluoxetine burp makes me want to ralph.
1000	1000	1	@TheMartinNewman to be honest I've had worse. On fluoxetine I was convinced there was a plot to steal my thoughts... !
1000	1000	1	Slept 11 hours last night on seroquel o.O
1000	1000	1	My medication is making me stupid, brain meds are not ok , fuck u paxil
1000	1000	1	@almostwell what problems did you have with humira, if you don't mind me asking. I tried infliximab it destroyed my liver.
1000	1000	1	@RipnerCabbit @pacerfox Ugh. My partner was on Paxil for a while. It made him hide in the apartment. :/
1000	1000	1	@MarkMcGahan80 does the Tysabri make you tired at first after infusion, not that you need an excuse to be tired! Sleep well xx :o) xx
1000	1000	1	No #Vyvanse = eat everything in sight.
1000	1000	1	Only problem is I'm hungry. Seroquel nation hunger :(
1000	1000	1	My mood swings are getting worse and lamotrigine isn't helping at all.…
1000	1000	1	Fuck you, effexor. Dilated pupils and blurry vision and nausea and headaches? This is awful!
1000	1000	1	@beckysrecovery I have been on amisulpride but only for a few days, I could not tolerate nausea and akathisia, olanzapine I can cope with
1000	1000	1	I've been so tired since I started the Cymbalta. I sleep so much. Case in point: just slept an hour before bed.
1000	1000	1	Has anyone ever had to take Avelox? I need some tricks to curb the nausea and help me with the hypotension. #avelox #antibiotic #evil
1000	1000	1	I guess the Doctor was right when he said don't eat any dairy products within 2 hours of taking this Levofloxacin. #almostanaccident 3 times
1000	1000	1	@SonnieDetore I cannot be in the sun! #levaquin
1000	1000	1	@crohns_twins that sucks. Humira made me so sick. Remicade helped a but, but then seizures put that out. Now waiting, just prednisone now.
1000	1000	1	I've had no appetite since I started on Prozac, I guess that's a good thing
1000	1000	1	Note to self - nicotine lozenge & alcohol = nausea.
1000	1000	1	Act now and get our deluxe CYDE-FX set ABSOLUTELY FREE! Experience lucid dreaming and sleep paralysis like never before! #Quetiapine
1000	1000	1	Try to take seroquel and alcohol all at the same time and your world will be like aersdd ';&$*£¢©°^÷[< gjluvzcf arfrcgjklkjf!'%$&@%*-;& YUP
1000	1000	1	@wickychoo @LollyGee OMG ALL THE SPECIAL PLACES. I'm not drunk. It's the fluoxetine.
1000	1000	1	@Jonny_Wags @Hey_Jeffrey Realtalk: until I started taking Wellbutrin, Effexor robbed me of the ability to cum
1000	1000	1	@ZNB_Maqbool sweaty fluoxetine addict
1000	1000	1	I think baclofen might make me a bigger asshole than usual. :/
1000	1000	1	21.19 day 17 Rivaroxaban diary. Aches are related to pressure on my body, e.g. If sitting then in back, buttoocks and legs 1/2
1000	1000	1	Will still be on the Geodon, but will also be taking a low-dose alprazolam as needed for the sudden anxiety attacks ive been getting
1000	1000	1	05.00 day 17 Rivaroxaban diary. Woken up by pain in neck, hips and legs.
1000	1000	1	FOUND THEM. Starting back up on Effexor. Vomits shall ensue!
1000	1000	1	@amanda_stand @mycuriousmind wow. Venlafaxine and mirtazapine must be very sedative. I’ve had them before separately n was knocked out-ishX
1000	1000	1	@ItsMeCreezy I hate to hear that. Taking seroquel is like swallowing a sleeping pill when u wake up then trying to function normally
1000	1000	1	I've been getting almost daily headaches for the past 3 weeks side effects of #enbrel ? I've been on it for months now though #rheum
1000	1000	1	02.03 Rivaroxaban diary day 20. Some neck pain and legs still weak, but feeling much better. Very warm night.
1000	1000	1	@LithiumLibGirl I can relate to the olanzapine lbs, but you'll be great!
1000	1000	1	@Glass1ncision It's called Seroquel Prolong (Quetiapine). Apart from the weight gain, I am actually quite happy with it.
1000	1000	1	@raCanuck I had a weird rash w/ Enbrel. But it was all over my abdomen & chest. Rash in elbow cld b psoriasis? Can u take a pic?
1000	1000	1	I don't know whether my Vyvanse caused my caffeine addiction or caffeine caused my Vyvanse addiction.
1000	1000	1	#EDS friends! Anybody taken #Cipro? (antibiotic) Complications?? Big side effect is tendon rupture...figured my dr would know better?
1000	1000	1	Question: recently I have been hyper-sensitive to different textures, does anyone know if this is a bipolar / lamotrigine thing??
1000	1000	1	Nicotine withdrawals #2DaysDown #ForeverToGo #headache #irritable #toomanyhashtags #makeitstop

1000	1000	1	@doctorchristian I take olanzapine and have a permanent dry mouth what can I do to help it
1000	1000	1	@southkirk @PositiveAboutMS Thinking it might be the baclofen doing it.Only on a low dose though.Broken sleep is a nightmare.#MSFatigue
1000	1000	1	its your third visit in 2 weeks for priapism and you're still taking trazodone @ERProblem
1000	1000	1	@Eqinnastra all the time! I took trazodone last night and it really helped- but it was difficult to wake up :-/
1000	1000	1	04.46 day 23 rivaroxaban diary. Much better than yesterday. Still neck, back, hip, and leg aches but not so intense.
1000	1000	1	Vyvanse and seroquel #TwoThingsThatDontMixWell
1000	1000	1	@pseudodeviant i clock in at 16 stone (added 1 stone since quetiapine) and according to that BMI thing I'm obese, which I'm clearly not.
1000	1000	1	@trainingwithra but #Humira has the after-sting, which is worse! Yuck. Reminds me, I need to go take my shot :) #rheum
1000	1000	1	@SDunn242 yup quetiapine. The normal dose at night whacks me out. I'd have been asleep til Friday on double
1000	1000	1	@BurberryWife sometimes it never ends. So sorry. Topomax is miserable with parasthesia, cognitive problems, kidney stones. Lamictal's good
1000	1000	1	Me: Why have I been sectioned, what psychotic symptoms do I have? Psychiatrist: Dancing. I am now addicted to the antipsychotic olanzapine
1000	1000	1	Got offered a seat on the tube this morning. Quetiapine, like pregnancy, but hungrier. #bipolarlifestylechoice
1000	1000	1	I think this Olanzapine makes me crazier.
1000	1000	1	What! Nightmare made me jump awake! Not nice at all. Thought #quetiapine was supposed to keep me asleep through the night #psychosis #fail
1000	1000	1	one of the things i hate most about quetiapine is when i take it for the first few hours i slur my words, so people assume i'm merely drunk.
1000	1000	1	@itwasntbay yeah when I take vyvanse any food just looks/sounds/tastes fucking disgusting
1000	1000	1	I shouldn't tweet on vyvanse it's going to be extremely negative lol
1000	1000	1	I seem to need to sleep right now. Quetiapine takers, is this normal?
1000	1000	1	okay i took the seroquel and i am resisting the urge to vomit it up i feel disgusting but oH WELL GOOD TIMES GOOD VIBES DON'T BE SAD
1000	1000	1	@OUCH_UK didnt know Lamotrigine was addictive Stopped as didnt think were helping @clusterheads 3 days of hell before realized, back on now
1000	1000	1	Playing league while on vyvanse is too damn stressful. Back to public I go!
1000	1000	1	I don't know whether my Vyvanse caused my caffeine addiction or caffeine caused my Vyvanse addiction.
1000	1000	1	@mizbergy that's the hardest part: difficult to willingly self-inflict pain. #Humira #rheum
1000	1000	1	@_cimmy_ thanks! yes, after I was prescribed Cipro a few years ago, and it REALLY messed me up, I am quite wary of broad spectrum ones.
1000	1000	1	Day 11 of #rwrunstreak completed. 1.32 miles of walking. Can't run even if I could because of Cipro. Also day 4 of mostly raw was good.
1000	1000	1	Restless Leg Syndrome is bad tonight. Damn you fluoxetine.
1000	1000	1	@DystoniaSociety I would like to know what everyone else's experience are of baclofen and clonazepam. Do they get dry nose / throat?
1000	1000	1	@whatkatie_did I'm certainly weird but it's quetiapine instead of crack, I can't get that on prescription.
1000	1000	1	Gotta find an alternative to Vyvanse, ASAP. I'd rather be sleepy & happy, than alert & depressed!
1000	1000	1	Day 4: The initial lamotrigine lethargy kicked in the day before exams. I tell myself that possible failure is better than possible death.
1000	1000	1	Have any of you developed knee pain since starting Tysabri ? What helps with the problem ?
1000	1000	1	@AquafarE The only things I know I'm allergic to are sulfa drugs and ciprofloxacin.
1000	1000	1	Am I the only one that grinds the shit out of their teeth on vyvanse? #cantbetheonlyone #icouldstudyforfinalsidonthave
1000	1000	1	Medication side-affects have hit me hard today: I keep on randomly jolting or rocking, it is so bad I am finding it hard to type! #Seroquel
1000	1000	1	@DoctorChristian is my memory really bad due to 900mg seroquel and 120mg cymbalta or the bipolar itself? I'm not remembering conversations
1000	1000	1	A big ol' fuck you to my doctor for not telling me a side effect of metoprolol was depression. Just wait until I see you Friday -.-
1000	1000	1	Does anyone on #tysabri get flu Iike symptoms, aches and pains, shivers a sweats I seem to get it about a week or so after I've had infusion
1000	1000	1	Extra Quetiapine and two Zopiclone still aren't helping me sleep. Head full of broken biscuits at 4am with horrid intrusive thoughts
1000	1000	1	@WarWraith I'm not even sure what to request. :/ Sertraline makes me sick now, Venlafaxine made me sick, Reboxetine and Citalopram useless
1000	1000	1	@TweetNomDePlume SSRIs were great for me for ages, not working as well now. Thus Seroquel. I’m also on Clonazepam, makes me sleepy too.

1000	1000	1	@Sectioned_ @bipolarlife7 @BBCWomansHour ah yes, I'm starting to think my paroxetine turns panic attacks into fat.
1000	1000	1	This higher dose of #cymbalta is making me extremely tired and anxious. Is this normal?
1000	1000	1	I don't know whether my Vyvanse caused my caffeine addiction or caffeine caused my Vyvanse addiction.
1000	1000	1	If this fuckin EMT looks at me one more time hes gonna feel the wrath of my vyvanse rage
1000	1000	1	@AnitaAlibi Paxil didn't end up helping. Tried Prozac and Wellbutrin and it helped my mood and anxiety but gave me vertigo. :(
1000	1000	1	My Effexor has left me with the inability to cry. I was dry eyed watching "Into the Wild" and even one of those Sarah Mclachlan commercials

1000	1000	1	I knew one day enbrel would b the death of me
1000	1000	1	Seroquel aka wake up at 2:30 and waste half your day sleeping.
1000	1000	1	I reckon I have drug-induced oedema causing musculo-skeletal pain. Likely drug combination: Rivaroxaban, Losartan, and Simvastatin.
1000	1000	1	it's 6 am and still no sleep fuck you vyvanse
1000	1000	1	20.12 day 15 rivaroxaban diary. Haven't yet taken today's tablet. Will when I eat. Still intense lower back pain from yesterday's tablet.

1000	1000	1	@AshleyLVivian if #Avelox has HURT YOUR Liver, AVOID Tylenol ALWAYS, as it further damages LIVER, eat Grapefruit unless taking Cardiac drugs
1000	1000	1	@mikedelic if this is a real question, withdrawal from an antidepressant named Effexor was worse than cocaine withdrawal
1000	1000	1	Humira + thioguanine + preds = me have no immune lol.. Thankgod i on anti biotics for a bit... Then preds drop off #crohns
1000	1000	1	@charlienicola85 someones said can happen while fighting infection which is quite possible,nearly finished some cipro&bringing up foul gunk!
1000	1000	1	@JKIronSTAR i had panic and aniexty orders a few years ago before i took paxil but i never freaked out on ppl and cried hysterically
1000	1000	1	@fibrofighter08 Venlafaxine gave me horrendous nightmares, & coming of it was horrific.!
1000	1000	1	Oh hey. Much like other anti-convulsants, Lamictal dehydrates you. So much is explained.
1000	1000	1	seroquel is causing more gaps in memory, I don't remember going to therapy and as usual no one has stepped up to claim thos memories >>
1000	1000	1	@Ana_3033 fluoxetine give me headaches and makes me yawn 24/7

1000	1000	1	@thebookgirl985 Trazodone makes me HUNGRY. Prop my eyelids open with toothpicks and drive me to a buffet?
1000	1000	1	I couldn't remember if I took a vyvanse or not early so I took another one &now I'm spazzing out... bc obviously I took one already #adhd
1000	1000	1	Levaquin sucks. Blinding headaches. Vomiting. Diarrhea. Time for my next dose. Happy weekend. #tmi #FML
1000	1000	1	When I had my infected K stone, hospital put me on Cipro - a synthetic antibiotic. I "smelled" a pungent solvent odor, I smell it now. Why?
1000	1000	1	@redbuttongirl I know. I just realised with everything else - I haven't taken the sodding quetiapine yet!! Wondered why I wasn't drowsy DOH!
1000	1000	1	great.. I have hives up and down my legs from this gosh dang trazodone
1000	1000	1	@CaroleWhelan I find the baclofen worse, it has left me in a tired/sleepy fog all day - the codeine I can (mostly) deal with.
1000	1000	1	@OisEucalypt I was on muscle relaxant Baclofen for two weeks, then 2 months trying to rid myself of it. 11 days in without and no sleep. :/
1000	1000	1	My mind races when I'm on a vyvanse
1000	1000	1	ciprofloxacin: how do you expect to sleep when your stomach is a cement mixer?
1000	1000	1	Zoloft was just as bad as Effexor. It made me more depressed and more suicidal. I don't want it.
1000	1000	1	Effexor XR side effects : - sucidal thoughts - insomnia - feeling high & unresponsible. -Dry mouth.
1000	1000	1	You know starting with geodon, the meds messed up my attitude. How odd. It's not just about spirituality. I became a bit mean. That got
1000	1000	1	@liver_bird_87 @MizTinkerbella when I was on cymbalta and visanne I could not orgasm at all!!!
1000	1000	1	I think that Vyvanse is making me grind my teeth...
1000	1000	1	personally I prefer staying up until I get hallucinations, to taking seroquel to get to sleep, but only because it's more fun for me
1000	1000	1	@MerePrototype Probably the combination with my fluoxetine. But I can't move that to night time, it makes me have bad dreams.
1000	1000	1	Paxil withdrawal is nasty. Do not like.
1000	1000	1	No pain is worse than Humira. Not even arthritis. Lmfao.
1000	1000	1	Holy shit balls pristiq withdrawals are very strong!
1000	1000	1	My choice was more #surgery on 6-ft small bowel or #Biologics like #Humira. Now #chemo is my only hope 2 treat #lung side effect. #Crohns
1000	1000	1	I'm void of nicotine and my moods are void of stability.
1000	1000	1	Do you know how badly I want a cigarette right now? But no. I manfully suffer through nicotine withdrawal—all for you #sacrifice
1000	1000	1	do i come off my medication or do i just continue to be a prozac zombie
1000	1000	1	Hey guys don't forget to refill your Paxil for like six days because the withdrawal is like heroin. Literally.
1000	1000	1	@MVRCIVL VYVANSE GOT ME UP LIKE ZOMBIES.. XAN'S PUT ME DOWN, THEM BITCHES CALL ME ROMNEY.. THE WAY I STEADY CLOWN #txfreestyle #barrdout
1000	1000	1	me : feeling fine, watching tv ... swiffer commercial #lamotrigine : Lol lets make the bitch cry at this... a fucking swiffer commercial.
1000	1000	1	Going off Paxil CR cold turkey is something you should never ever do if you value your brain cells.
1000	1000	1	Anyone taking lamotrigine suffer with headaches weeks after starting the med?
1000	1000	1	(cont'd) My pdoc altered the dosage of @Fluoxetine to 30mg. That's the only alteration. Because I complained about the extreme fatigue. :-(
1000	1000	1	Things which are the Spawn of Satin: mosquitoes, bananas, Facebook, Paxil withdrawal symptoms. #BewareOfSatin
1000	1000	1	@TheOnlyWayIsGay Fluoxetine. Killed my libido stone dead.
1000	1000	1	Fucking Effexor withdrawals. I would shake my fist but I don't have the energy.
1000	1000	1	@cheer_bear13 am on 300mg Quetiapine. Mainly tiredness it causes with me.
1000	1000	1	@epilepsysociety I have a Q..I am taking lamotrigine and wondered if anyone else has had insomnia as a side effect?and what to do about it
1000	1000	1	This seroquel is hitting me soo hard with this beer
1000	1000	1	@hello_nacho @tobiasampersand Lexapro gave me the worst mixed episodes. I have some instability with Pristiq but I can manage it ok.
1000	1000	1	-9.5lbs in 14 days. Obvious now that I should have stopped the quetiapine a long long time ago before I got in this state
1000	1000	1	#lamotrigine headaches suck :( i wanna curl up & cry.
1000	1000	1	Maybe cos of the insulin blocking effect of seroquel but I do feel sugar crashes when eat fast carbs. Will feel ill. So avoid where poss.
1000	1000	1	@Mannypresh602 word. I've been fuckin tweakin out on vyvanse and writing hella verses
1000	1000	1	@stavvers Yeah I hear epilim is pretty tough, sorry to hear re bad times with it :( Oddly, dear sweet Lamotrigine tipped me to a dark place
1000	1000	1	It feels like my brain is melting. 360mg of vyvanse in 24 hours... not smart danielle. not smart.
1000	1000	1	Vyvanse is a hell of a drug. You get expensive insomnia! And you get expensive insomnia!
1000	1000	1	@MagnoliaPearl Missing a day of meds is never fun. I get migraines if I don't get my Effexor. Do you just get super tired?
1000	1000	1	@renegade_snare @IBDTweet I feel your pain :( just got 1st #fistula URGH ! Humira worked for me for just 3months then got painful reactions
1000	1000	1	Seroquel left me with sleep paralysis. Abilify left me with occasional muscle spasms. I've been off of both for nearly a decade.
1000	1000	1	Ok brain & body. We need a chat about oversleeping and overeating since taking Olanzapine again #tuboficecream #timetochange #junkfood #gym
1000	1000	1	@levaquin Levaquin poisoned me and ruined my life! Constant pain 24/7! I hate you, Levaquin!
1000	1000	1	@jessicama20045 You know that Cipro is also made by Bayer, right? And it ALSO causes a horrific syndrome that mimics an auto-immune disease.
1000	1000	1	Day 6 cold turkey from Effexor. I believe this pic adequately represents my descent into madness. Or whatever.pic.twitter.com/Vz0oFABIA0
1000	1000	1	@remiamaka It wasn't an easy victory though. Felt like chemo with the Cipro. As for the heart, i meant for study purposes.
1000	1000	1	“@dipndots95: My vyvanse makes me nocturnal ”
1000	1000	1	Paroxetine, may make it hard to have an orgasm.
1000	1000	1	@thebeachynurse ...had to get an x-ray of my arm per protocol...it was negative but it's just now starting to hurt. Ugh!!!! #Geodon
1000	1000	1	@letti4u :( I'm sorry to hear that. I had a side effect from Humira that negated all TNF blockers so no Enbrel for me either. :( #rheum
1000	1000	1	@MissMazyGG anxiety has been so high. But yeah, if your dosage is high its hard to come off. I had to detox from pristiq (its cousin drug)
1000	1000	1	#cymbalta withdrawal has reached a peak, lost vision and almost crashed my car from a brain zap. thanks a zillion #elililly #bigpharma
1000	1000	1	@theJeremyVine I once had an allergic reaction to the anti-convulsant Lamotrigine. I got a rash all over my body that looked like burns.
1000	1000	1	@AmyBadkin @Kate24Hrs_aDay not to worry - just a bit of temporary fuzziness. I've been on Humira since 2007 & love it.
1000	1000	1	When the depression is coming out caused by this damn levofloxacin :))
1000	1000	1	Eurgh! Last time I was this tired, I was on a four day antidepressant cocktail binge. #seroxat #sertraline #fluoxitine #lithium
1000	1000	1	I really hate the fact that I feel like I need to throw up while at work. Maybe taking my vyvanse wasn't a good idea
1000	1000	1	Being sick every morning is getting really old. Not sure if anxiety or my body getting used to Paxil. Anyone know?
1000	1000	1	Your humira shot burns with the power of a thousand suns #IBDFMLMoments #Crohns #IBD #UC
1000	1000	1	Fuck Paxil. I never want to take this shit again, but every time I try I get ridiculously sick. My life suckssss.
1000	1000	1	So, I lasted 16 days on Seroquel. I couldn't handle the awful side effects. Constantly dizzy and lightheadeded & a myriad of other bad stuff
1000	1000	1	I hate how vyvanse makes me over think everything and it makes me angry about things that I shouldn't even be angry about
1000	1000	1	Meds paranoia cos my leg is itching #lamictal #bipolar
1000	1000	1	@Privacy625 @sandycolon25 what I take is SERIOUS. I never was informed ahead of time. I could get "metabolic" syndrome from Seroquel.
1000	1000	1	Found out that it could be two months before I sleep well again now that I'm off Seroquel. Srsly, fuck the psychiatrist that put me on it.
1000	1000	1	Plus this antibiotic is making me stupid and clumsy. Cipro is evil but the fever is gone.
1000	1000	1	Just took seroquel. Now I'm freaking out that I will end up sleeping 15 hrs and miss my 12pm appt tomorrow
1000	1000	1	@AgentMariaHill I've taken the BP daily if not twice a day like I should, it's juz I didn't think the Effexor would spike it so. I'm usually
1000	1000	1	@AuthorEdKurtz Oh, it sucks, but try doing SNRI withdrawal. They had to put me on a whole other drug just to get me off Effexor. :(
1000	1000	1	@Wee_Jendo Nicotine lozenges. If I go cold turkey I can’t think (or see) straight, so I can’t work.
1000	1000	1	@disabledmedic Quetiapine perhaps gives most dramatic effect for single low dose. No, pts are not being lazy in bed 20 hours a day, asleep!
1000	1000	1	I feel siiiiiiiiiiiiiiick. Damn you venlafaxine.
1000	1000	1	vyvanse makes me so fucking talkative I feEL LIKE A NORMAL PERSON
1000	1000	1	@ObsidianVormund @Glass1ncision sorry for jumping in. Trying to get up for work after night seroquel is a nightmare!
1000	1000	1	@rachelhatesjazz Watch your eyesight with Lamictal- I went from awesome vision, to wearing glasses full time for the 2 yrs I was on it.
1000	1000	1	Day 3 without #venlafaxine. Worst drug ever to withdraw from? Any support much appreciated!
1000	1000	1	For anxiety to penetrate through my drowsy haze (a result of the triumvirate of fluoxetine, pregabalin, amoxicillin?) is pretty good going.
1000	1000	1	@Azlemed first two weeks of olanzapine v drowsy. weight gain was an issue. Great for my anxiety though.
1000	1000	1	@aravain I've heard of all kinds of skin issues on Lamictal! pretty sure mine is psychosomatic though...
1000	1000	1	@arzbrocki Nawh Bactrim. Cipro made me sick once.
1000	1000	1	@bullfrogr @Soozmc123 amil isnt so bad, paxil makes everything slow and haldol is ok, and haldol .. i dunno how to explain what it does
1000	1000	1	@lotsOspermies well I’m taking it with a mood stabilizer (Lamictal). I can’t take anti-depressants by themselves-triggers my rapid cycling
1000	1000	1	But still Dr. Maria Jasinskas was right & would have been if not for Pharmacy; She said, "You know sometimes Vyvanse can make you depressed"
1000	1000	1	@Holeri81 Crippled since Oct of '09 thanks to just 12 Cipro pills here...run for your life! Tendon rupture is only the tip of the iceberg.
1000	1000	1	After taking olanzapine I wake up and feel like I am in a straight jacket because my muscles feel stiff
1000	1000	1	@RayvenMental Yeah the first time I was on olanzapine I did not put much weight on but 2nd time I did! Weird!
1000	1000	1	If this fuckin EMT looks at me one more time hes gonna feel the wrath of my vyvanse rage
1000	1000	1	Vyvanse masks me so depressed
1000	1000	1	@sickleSTRONG Word to the wise: Don't swallow Cipro AT ALL!!! It is POISON and can cripple you for life! Is your situation life or death?
1000	1000	1	Not to mention the thousands of people online who say they’ve stacked on the weight due to taking seroquel.
1000	1000	1	I have been on Seroquel (Quetiapine) for so long I don't even know what the side-effects are! Although, I think overheating is definitely 1.
1000	1000	1	@Bare_Faced_Chic I've had to reduce the quetiapine back to 400mg. Couldn't take the increased gastro pain. Was crumpled in a heap crying x
1000	1000	1	I need help Twitter. I was gradually coming off venlafaxine and now I'm completely off it I've been going though hell.
1000	1000	1	08.55 day 21 Rivaroxaban diary strange muscle spasms especially in neck shoulders and legs. No more fluid retention. More mobile.
1000	1000	1	@LISABROWNPHOTOS Consider yourself lucky if all it does is make you dizzy and sick! Cipro crippled me and countless others.
1000	1000	1	@KieraRampton It's called lamotrigine, I'm pretty sure the mix of them both is making me sick. I don't think bipolar & ADD mix very well..
1000	1000	1	"Prozac and Paxil have the same effects." WELL, SHIT. NO WONDER I FUCKING HAVE INSOMNIA AFTER I TOLD HIM I HAVE IT.
1000	1000	1	@darko_marco I've no probs with porn other than the fact that I've gained 80 pounds on Effexor and no one needs to see that ;-)
1000	1000	1	Cipro makes my nose feel like its bleeding. But it's not. #phantomsangre
1000	1000	1	I do wonder of that Achille's will ever recover fully from the Cipro.
1000	1000	1	EVERYONE: I HAVE A DRUG ADDICTION TO SEROQUEL, I TAKE 6 A YEAR, HELP ME STOP
1000	1000	1	@Dani_DeeH Nope, I tested positive for JCV. JCV & Tysabri = permanent brain damage or sudden death.
1000	1000	1	@cutefont I essentially felt nothing on them. Great for anxiety, bad for living. Coming off klonopin and paxil was hell though.
1000	1000	1	@MidwesternWife i feel your pain, im allergic to penicillin, ammoxicillin, levaquin, doxycycline. it sucks
1000	1000	1	@ikimlowe my son has been on Lamictal for 3 yrs n broke out in a rash when he 1st was put on it. Luckily after going to ER it was not the SJ
1000	1000	1	Since Enbrel helped relive my joint pain , my hearings gone , I can't feel my legs ,have 3 eyes, an xtra kid ,but I can still play Golf .
1000	1000	1	@stillicides well no. But it's just that I dropped my quetiapine last night. I slept horribly! But I feel v unfoggy...
1000	1000	1	Seriously haven't ate one thing ALL damn day.. #vyvanse #add #damn
1000	1000	1	@deadfanclub @DanaDelany I have a penicillin/ keflex allergy so my dr writes me 10 days of zpack or I'd still be sick too! Sometimes cipro
1000	1000	1	I need to progress onto oxazepam.Apparently it's more sedating. Seroquel is sedating, but you can hardly open or close your mouth.
1000	1000	1	That zyprexa really makes your vocal chords marvelous only it makes you gain so much weight
1000	1000	1	Seroquel gives me nightmares every fucking night but I take it anyway
1000	1000	1	All I have to say is Cipro will mess you up kids. Don't get sick! #blagh #gross #weak
1000	1000	1	@Zombie_girl_2 I tried that going cold turkey on venlafaxine and depakote is not a good idea I dreamt colours and lost my fucking mind aghh!
1000	1000	1	@whiskey_girl33 oh yuck. We all have our least favorite body fluid. Mine is aerosolized blood. Nosebleed on Xarelto -eeeew
1000	1000	1	@RayyDePotter yeaa bihh all jacked up on vyvanse!
1000	1000	1	“@vyvanseswag: I don't know whether my Vyvanse caused my caffeine addiction or caffeine caused my Vyvanse addiction.” OMG SO TRUE!! Ahh!
1000	1000	1	I haven't slept in 2 days due to #vyvanse
1000	1000	1	@CIPROisPOISON ironically, the pulmonologist I work with told me about his own devastating bout with 'tendonitis' after Cipro
1000	1000	1	@cloudtoad @MrsYisWhy @bigthink each brain is different. The SSRI I'm on has worked really well. Prozac made me a zombie. #Brains
1000	1000	1	Losing it. Could not remember the word power strip. Wonder which drug is doing this memory lapse thing. My guess the Cymbalta. #helps
1000	1000	1	Mann I've been having the munchies ALL day eatin weird shxt ahaha my zyprexa gotta nigga tearin up food
1000	1000	1	@RachaelHerron @marrije I haaaated Trazodone. Don't be afraid to ask doc for something else if side effects continue. Gave me migraines.
1000	1000	1	@trainingwithra Nope, was on #Enbrel 5yrs & had to get off due to unrelenting flare. Been on #Humira since Dec 2012. #rheum
1000	1000	1	"do you have any medication allergies?" "ASTHMA!!!" Me: "........" Pt: "no wait. avelox, that's it!" "So no other allergies?" "RIGHT!" *cont
1000	1000	1	@ctr1945 my mom used Rivaroxaban and it gave her a terrible time with weakness and muscle pain.
1000	1000	1	@LilythePurr I've had too much quetiapine today - I'm zombified.
1000	1000	1	@Kirkby007 #hcsm I start #Chemo on Tues b/c of #humira so I know. It helped but it then destroyed my lungs.
1000	1000	1	Why do I always get the seroquel munchies!?
1000	1000	1	Exhausted...can't fall asleep. Don't wanna take a trazadone and wake up hungover. #Sleepdisorderproblems
1000	1000	1	Don't need any alcohol really when fluoxetine just makes me feel like I can't even stand
1000	1000	1	@thebeecharmer97 @deadfanclub I would NOT recommend toying around with Cipro if you don't have to. Did you know it can cripple you for life?
1000	1000	1	@stevecoy @JoelAnair all the things I have just make me sleepy as hell: Cymbalta, Klonopin, Ambien. wait what if I take em all togethhssaagg
1000	1000	1	@opium_district I've been having them today too, three days without effexor. I completely understand what you mean. every hit, lightheaded..
1000	1000	1	I don't know if vyvanse was a good idea #nosleep
1000	1000	1	I need more energy today. Don't know where to get it from, though. This is the result of going off #Tysabri for #MSandLife and heat-related.
1000	1000	1	How anyone can say there is no withdrawal from prozac withdrawal is beyond me. Their answer is to go back on it and up the dose.
1000	1000	1	@abianne the Effexor may have been pushing me toward hypomania, so we are trying just an ssri, then see if a mood stabilizer is needed.
1000	1000	1	@AnyssiaKaissa Depakote made me feel flat, but helps many. Zyprexa can cause weight gain, so be very careful. I can't tolerate it.
1000	1000	1	@SamAmbreen venlafaxine definitely does mine. Also makes me need 15 hours sleep a day. Hence now unmediated & rollercoastery.
1000	1000	1	I finally had an appetite, made food, gone. HUMIRA WHY WON'T YOU LET ME EAT
1000	1000	1	really bad RLS fron seroquel :(
1000	1000	1	@ayegraybay I knowwishful thinking. My Humira shot doesn't even work for me anymore and when it does I get so sick.
1000	1000	1	It can get really cold when you have a Halls lozenge
1000	1000	1	vyvanse keep me straight but I can't eat shit when I'm on em
1000	1000	1	Achilles tendon rupture is a side effect of fluoroquinolones #fact stay away from Cipro!!!!
1000	1000	1	@twistedwillow @SamAmbreen apologies if gatecrashing. I was like walking dead when first started venlafaxine, much better now dose stable
1000	1000	1	#restlesslegs #quetiapine
1000	1000	1	Day seven off the baclofen and I've got cold sweats and constant insomnia... I'm running on fumes at this point.
1000	1000	1	Promise, brownies honor I'm not stupid, i have been forgetting everything lately #paxil
1000	1000	1	Wish it was Monday...seeing doctor tomorrow & want to see if he has any suggestions for my withdrawal. #paroxetine #anxiety #fedup
1000	1000	1	@NireBryce Thanks. There is a nonzero chance that the discomfort I am feeling was caused by going back on Cymbalta, possibly too quickly.
1000	1000	1	I think I'm gong to speak my GP about reducing Quetiapine dosage. The weight gain from it is scaring the hell out of me.
1000	1000	1	@Kirkby007 If u r on #humira and have respiratory probs - see ur doc. That;s how it all started of me. Be well. Nice chatting,
1000	1000	1	@Sectioned_ Anybody know anything about side effects of venlafaxine? Come off 'em 6wks ago, still feeling awful. physical withdrawal awful
1000	1000	1	Does cipro make anyone's else's brain turn to mush or am I actually just going crazy?
1000	1000	1	@TheEastMovie Thank you so much for getting the message out...wish I could see the film but Bayer CRIPPLED ME with Cipro back in 2009!
1000	1000	1	@ABittersweet1 Cipro destroyed my entire body, from head to toe. Bedridden since 2009. Be VERY careful.
1000	1000	1	Nicotine is literally poison. But sometimes you gotta find out the hard way. #headache
1000	1000	1	Restless Leg Syndrome is bad tonight. Damn you fluoxetine.
1000	1000	1	@dsymons @trainingwithra I agree that the after sting is much worse from #humira than #enbrel #rheum
1000	1000	1	All I have done today is sleep. And I still need to sleep more. This is a welcome change. #quetiapine
1000	1000	1	Only change so far since switching from Lexapro to Cymbalta: now I might notice if I got hit in the crotch w/ a lance in a jousting accident
1000	1000	1	Cymbalta, my mood has worsened
1000	1000	1	@almostwell My blood pressure is fine, but my heart started lurching two weeks ago. Savella didn't work for me, yeah. Cymbalta rules!
1000	1000	1	@Lanternlizard cymbalta switch is part of what made me flip. But any snri with family hx of mania puts you at risk.
1000	1000	1	I can feel my heart starting to palpitate from vyvanse, red bull, and nicotine. That's probably par for the course for finals week, right?
1000	1000	1	I'm sorry you have ostrich halitosis @DanielleJMoody but that IS a side effect of once monthly boniva.
1000	1000	1	@sam_dietrich just had the Viibryd vision shake thing again very cool
1000	1000	1	and now I can feel the seroquel melting my brain, so it's time to sleep. May my dreams be filled with visions of mechanical sex.
1000	1000	1	Had a dream my eyes got burned out of my head. Thank you trazodone
1000	1000	1	@jennyelliott88 FFS!! I'm getting shooting pains down arms & legs now & In eve whole body ache #humira is horrible
1000	1000	1	I've probably gained a good seven or eight pounds on Paxil. My 5'2 and small frame can't deal w that. Lol get me off the crazy meds ASAP!!!
1000	1000	1	@ReneeLiedig Hi idk who you are but I just wanted to let you know I gained over 20 lbs on Paxil. Be watchful.
1000	1000	1	@scrabalisios I hav to come of the duloxetine immediately as I hav a terrible rash because of it! Had the rash 2 weeks
1000	1000	1	Officially addicted to nicotine
1000	1000	1	Just wondering where the side effect of hating the world is stated on vyvanse advertisements?
1000	1000	1	I have put on weight (thanks MS and #Tysabri). Always look on the bright side: time for a @thinkgeek t-shirt spree! #winning
1000	1000	1	This #Seroquel Gotta Nigga feelin Like A Slow Turtle. #Ihatemeds
1000	1000	1	Going through a real bad nicotine withdraw...
1000	1000	1	It turns out that I can still ride a bike in spite of my ataxia (side effect of Lamotrigine) It has been at least 25 years.
1000	1000	1	Well! That was icky. I think Lamictal and Lexapro do not get along when taken within 3 hours of each other.
1000	1000	1	venlafaxine withdrawal is horrific
1000	1000	1	How is it that Vyvanse gives me dry mouth, but I still produce this much saliva in my sleep?

1000	1000	1	@dsymons @trainingwithra @lisabinkc my husband gives me my humira injections. We use the pens. It hurts too bad to give them to myself.
1000	1000	1	@Enlightenmentor Umm, are you being a smart-ass? Dont mess with me right now. Going through Cymbalta withdrawal I think & Im VERY depressed.
1000	1000	1	If you want to sleep for 15+ hours, take seroquel. Fuck i just woke up and it's 4
1000	1000	1	In other news, I've got my first weird side effect from quetiapine. Numbness and tingling in my fingertips.
1000	1000	1	Today's Pristiq withdrawal symptom: my eyeballs make a sound like Star Trek doors when I move them. #WTF
1000	1000	1	@ineedyouhere66 ugh the olanzapine makes me so tired :(
1000	1000	1	Paxil makes it nearly impossible to cry.
1000	1000	1	@JennNiff I didn't take a zopiclone in the end.. but I'm third day of no quetiapine & I'm eating incredibly differently!
1000	1000	1	Pretty sure the quetiapine was affecting my sense of taste
1000	1000	1	Ooooop. Anyone know if amoxicillin and pregabalin have an interaction? Never had one with fluoxetine and losartan... So dizzy!
1000	1000	1	I've had OCD symptoms like that for a while but seems like the Seroquel exacerbates things and now this. :\
1000	1000	1	Shouldn't have taken 80mg of vyvanse today... #cantsleep
1000	1000	1	20.05 day 16 Rivaroxaban diary. Intense back and knee pain most of day; taken more paracetamol. Had to shop, walking painful.
1000	1000	1	I decided to try visualization tapes again. At least they wouldn't give me a rash like Lamictal.
1000	1000	1	Cymbalta withdrawal <<<<<<<<
1000	1000	1	Crying randomly at nothing and everything. Sigh. Thank you #effexor #withdrawls Can you just exit my system already.
1000	1000	1	Don't ever take a vyvanse and drink an energy drink. Your heart will explode
1000	1000	1	@yobluemama2 Yep, my schizo-effective, as they labeled me, breast tumor is now cancerous .gee, the Seroquel didn't work. Psychiatry=crime!
1000	1000	1	@PK_Money I took a vyvanse and drank a 12oz redbull this morning. My heart was hurting a lil bit haha
1000	1000	1	Would like less vyvanse and more sleep in my life
1000	1000	1	@nanamack69 I'm here been in a seroquel coma lol
1000	1000	1	worked a double shift today while dealing with Effexor withdrawals, I'm a tough bitch; fight me. #badass #sick #withdraws #sicksicksick
1000	1000	1	@jephjacques I hated being on Paxil for that reason. Way to make you *more* depressed. x.x
1000	1000	1	bought ourselves an electronic cigarette for fun and now I think we're addicted to nicotine
1000	1000	1	Probably gonna up my dosage on the paxil...head still hurting a week later. Goddamn migraines. Please go away.
1000	1000	1	@deltrimental Effexor I found was not so bad. Currently on Cymbalta &the wdrawals are VILE. Internet full of horror stories,
1000	1000	1	@figster014 bloody zombie I also take venlafaxine thats for cronic depression bipolar is a difficult illness to deal with, both for the
1000	1000	1	@VanessaLovesJK because my dr switched from celexa to paxil and,paxil made me feel sick
1000	1000	1	Starting Humira tomorrow. :) I wonder if it will make me tired for a day or so like Remicade did. If it works, it's worth it.
1000	1000	1	#trazodone is one hell of a sleeping pill. it also makes you feel incredibly high.
1000	1000	1	My Philly dr prescribed me Trazodone,1pill made me so fkn sick, couldnt move 2day.Xtreme migraine, puke, shakes. Any1else get that react?
1000	1000	1	@CIPROisPOISON I'm in so much pain now... tendonitis, headaches, cognitive issues... I feel violated. #Cipro
1000	1000	1	I suppose the only concern is that the Lamotrigine is toxic in fairly low doses but I haven't actually taken an OD for 16 months.
1000	1000	1	Rivaroxaban 2/2 if I could float weightless in space I suspect I would not ache. But I can't so need rid of Rivaroxaban.
1000	1000	1	I've taken everything but my Trazodone that's tonight, but the nasal spray is giving me a drip :|
1000	1000	1	Taking trazodone and literally passing out on the bathroom floor yeah that shit happens
1000	1000	1	Apparently, Baclofen greatly exacerbates the "AD" part of my ADHD. Average length of focus today: about 30 seconds.
1000	1000	1	I'm feeling extra OCD right now. Like chill out Melissa. My vyvanse has me wired or something....
1000	1000	1	Half of seroquel knocks me out so fast and im asleep for at least 10 hours...
1000	1000	1	Today was hard - arguing with a professional. Was told seroquel doesn’t make you put on weight - I and my extra 20kg beg to differ.
1000	1000	1	Wanna go back to sleep, but this vyvanse ain't letting me
1000	1000	1	@Glinda_R @SpooniesCouch Cymbalta withdrawal is getting top billing at the moment, however. Ugh! xx
1000	1000	1	@BilgeEbiri Oh Robitussin dreams are notorious. Although what will really turn 'em into a Bunuel movie is Cipro.
1000	1000	1	I wonder if seroquel /then/ food still equals restless legs
1000	1000	1	Kinda worried about the nighttime jaw clenching from Effexor, what with my tongue ring and all... :L
1000	1000	1	When u have a throat lozenge in bed and wake up with that narsty taste in your mouth <
1000	1000	1	Oh, what a great idea watching Gordan Ramsay cook at 4am when I'm hungry from my seroquel.
1000	1000	1	@BroahEgan it's my nicotine withdrawls
1000	1000	1	@cheer_bear13 quetiapine knocked me sidewards for a week then I suddenly woke up activated. Then relapsed, upped dose, activated & so on
1000	1000	1	Tysabri bruises are the bestpic.twitter.com/L1gpZeFu5f
1000	1000	1	@BayerUSNews Sure is! I no longer even own a car after being crippled by Cipro (a BAYER product!). Who needs a car when you can't walk!?
1000	1000	1	13.08 Day 13 Rivaroxaban diary. Pracetamol has taken away most of the aches, but still have lower back ache and weak knees.
1000	1000	1	@RogerBezanis: Any ideas on treating depression naturally Paxil is making me gain unwanted pounds and water weight...Thanks
1000	1000	1	No med orders til Effexor is fully exited. Still having brain shivers, but mostly when I don't eat. #effexor #withdrawal #depression
1000	1000	1	i rilly want to get off cymbalta but i don't want to suffer through terrible withdrawals
1000	1000	1	@DoctorChristian Can reducing fluoxetine zap me of all energy?I've reduced from a high dose, now on standard does & not feeling good at all.
1000	1000	1	Round 2 trazodone. Please just put me to sleep, not make me into a zombie the whole next day.
1000	1000	1	Ok I've got a med ? Anyone ever tried cymbalta?? My doc put me on it but I slept 10 hrs straight!!
1000	1000	1	@IceDweller I loved Fluoxetine (prozac) but it made me lose my temper of the slightest thing but that was the only downside.
1000	1000	1	I'm so allergic to trazodone but I haven't been taking it so no one believes me :::---))))
1000	1000	1	On a related note: Tysabri causes weight gain. As does body pain/inability to exercise. Sigh. #fuckms
1000	1000	1	Bedtime. Hopefully the headache and nausea from the Levaquin will be gone leaving me with only the more common side effects of antibiotics.
1000	1000	1	I really feel like this fluoxetine is messing with my perspective time and people.
1000	1000	1	@Rowlegendary r u on any meds? my dreams on seroquel are fucked up
1000	1000	1	My hands & legs are holding a hate campaign against me. I can see us falling out if they don't sort themselves out #Diazepam #Baclofen
1000	1000	1	I don't like taking Seroquel at night. Makes me crabby the whole time the following day. Something about feeling sluggish and groggy. Aargh.
1000	1000	1	@trenchtimelow ooh. I was on seroquel. And withdrawal is a BITCH. I'm not even fully off it yet either.
1000	1000	1	Well. I abruptly stopped taking Lamotrigine (Lamictal), and that is why I am having the pain and weakness. Possible seizure. Oops.
1000	1000	1	@scdlifestyle Thanks for the podcast on FQ's...12 Cipro pills decimated my life in Oct of '09. I'm in Michigan here too (Lansing area).
1000	1000	1	seroquel and coffee don't really mix oops
1000	1000	1	2nd attempt in as many weeks to 'enjoy' a glass of wine didnt go to plan. Venlafaxine and wine do NOT mix. Gin and Tonic next then!
1000	1000	1	Anyone else have worsening #acne problems since starting #Enbrel for autoimmune disease?
1000	1000	1	God knows how I'm going to sleep tonight after sleeping 9 hours in the day #trazodone
1000	1000	1	@any1mouse jus Gt bck myself, hes puT me on citalopram in addition 2 the quetiapine! Im a bit worried as citalopram has made me manic before
1000	1000	1	I'm tired of being tired, deffinatly #nap time for this girl. Stupid #medications #paxil #trazodone #seroquel
1000	1000	1	Sent my lovely compandre to fuel my nicotine addiction
1000	1000	1	Although my bitching about being fat did look a but comical next to my brother, with his olanzapine induced weight gain.
1000	1000	1	@SamAmbreen doesn't work. Citilopram then fluoxetine before, bothe did nothing for my mood but made me vomit so much I lost 4 stone in 6mo.
1000	1000	1	Pretty sure my Vyvanse is making me dizzy and making my chest hurt.
1000	1000	1	@dougbremner I wish I'd have found your article sooner! I was crippled by Cipro in Oct of '09. Prescribed for a UTI & it didn't even help.
1000	1000	1	took 5, maybe 10 minutes to go from "why isn't the seroquel working" to "what is a bed, i will just use my keyboard"
1000	1000	1	@INukeYou And then I had horrible sleep once I took the trazodone. I just couldn't win, haha.
1000	1000	1	@Renbobs Prozac is the bartering stage. Tell them it's not working. DO NOT say "Friends say Duloxetine is like being on E 44 hours a day".
1000	1000	1	Well,yesterday was rubbish(post humira)all day in bed,loads of pain etc.Just got up and I think I'm alright?Give it an hour and reassess lol
1000	1000	1	@Joanne__Howe I'm good been on 25mg MTX for years then switched to leflunomide back MTX the other caused tummy trouble. Why r u off Enbrel
1000	1000	1	I Take 500mg Of Lamictal Everyday I'm Tired Leave Me Alone
1000	1000	1	"@Fleer09: Playing league while on vyvanse is too damn stressful. Back to public I go!"
1000	1000	1	@AmberInnerGlow @eclipsedblue Me too, Remicade for a year, Humira, and had an allergic reaction to Cimzia, almost killed me in November.
1000	1000	1	Trazodone has screwed up my sleep schedule. Its helping tho.
1000	1000	1	18.08 day 11 Rivaroxaban diary Intense back pain at a funeral from 10.30am. paracetamol eventually took it off. Very weak and aching knees
1000	1000	1	@adelerosenbloom SEROQUEL WILL KILL YOU. I am going to sue Astra Zeneca
1000	1000	1	@Butterflywgs ...my old ones! Plus caffeine in the morning counteracts these quite nicely whereas quetiapine hangovers were unshiftable
1000	1000	1	narcotic, benzo, etc rx's arent the only meds addictive. if i miss a dose of wellbutrin or effexor, my hands shake crazy & i get brain zaps
1000	1000	1	Hey not sleeping. #hotflashes #menopause #effexor
1000	1000	1	@NightTraumaDoc it works otherwise. My pcp started me on trazodone before. I felt like I.had a frontal lobotomy the following day
1000	1000	1	i had the two humira shots today and the needle didnt hurt at all but the mEDICINE INSIDE BURNED LIKE LAVA
1000	1000	1	@NickysAngelBaby Oy.. I'm allergic to Paxil. Makes me physically puke didn't understand why. I see a Psych. I'm on 100mg of Zoloft.
1000	1000	1	@Iamjoy1 yeah I know, I dont take my trazadone at night cause it makes me feel groggy in the morning and I wont wake to my alarm):
1000	1000	1	@deltrimental I came off pristiq in July last year. I still get brain zaps when tired. My genitals aren’t numb now tho - swings/roundabouts
1000	1000	1	@AmyJ2202 I'm a bit drunk its my prozac
1000	1000	1	Please be careful when withdrawing from any anti deps, benzos and/or hypnotics. Venlafaxine was a bad choice for me and worse withdrawl.
1000	1000	1	Have taken the Trazodone dose back down. Simply cannot put up with feeling tired all day!
1000	1000	1	feeling better and much less anxious (I could actually TALK to people yesterday) but the fluoxetine makes me sooooo sleepy...
1000	1000	1	FUCK HERE COMES THE NICOTINE CRAVINGS DAMN YOU HOOKAH
1000	1000	1	It's not even 11pm and I'm already feeling the Venlafaxine withdrawal. Stupid bitch. How hard is it to pack the bloody tablets?!
1000	1000	1	welll..decided to get off paxil. withdrawals are killlerrr, like loss of circulation randomly in areas.
1000	1000	1	When I was taking a full dose of #Paxil, I didn't even realize that sleeping 12 hours a night, then falling asleep every day, wasn't normal.
1000	1000	1	The day after Humira used to be a great one, full of energy, low pain. After a month, it is now a fatigue filled achy day. #rheum
1000	1000	1	The one bummer about it all is that the Fluoxetine is giving me the shakes which made fine fiddly detail work harder than it should be
1000	1000	1	I wonder if olanzapine causes restless legs <_<
1000	1000	1	I have some seriously disturbing dreams. Thanks #Fluoxetine thanks a freaking lot. Well I guess it's better than being #suicidal ..only just
1000	1000	1	I think I finally feel the last of the toxins slithering loudly out of my body. Dr's shouldn't prescribe medicine that does this. #effexor
1000	1000	1	Venlafaxine hangover finally starting to shift after 2 huge mugs of hot water with giant pieces of lemon...
1000	1000	1	@limeeleen @jennadell yup ,yup !!! one more thing ask her to watch her diet.......olanzapine can cause weight gain !
1000	1000	1	this lozenge is making my whole mouth numb... is that normal?
1000	1000	1	@Katie_Woodman fingers crossed I have been taken off tysabri because my body is resisting it ha typical hope you are doing ok :)
1000	1000	1	YOUNG NIGGA JUST GAVE ME A 70MG VYVANSE, THESE THINGS CAN TWERK ME OUT THANK GOODNESS FOR MY SCRIPT OF XANAX
1000	1000	1	@redbuttongirl combining them with the quetiapine makes me hallucinate :/
1000	1000	1	@xMandyJayne Trazodone is what he gave me while ago. That shit had me all tore up. I didn't like that shit haha.
1000	1000	1	To take my seroquel and have weird dreams or to not... Real life lyndsey world questions
1000	1000	1	@CandidlyKelly some day I should try fluoxetine again. it made me all suicidal the first time, but I was 18
1000	1000	1	@SugarrButt He has me on ciprofloxacin and phenazopyride I had severe pain that started over the weekend when trying to use
1000	1000	1	3 rounds of puking, a nasty headache, and my throat is raw. Body wants nothing to do with this increase in the Geodon.
1000	1000	1	high off tramadol and venlafaxine in school omg help I'm falling asleep here
1000	1000	1	03.25 day 13 Rivaroxaban diary. Neck ache and right shoulder ache. Lower back pain.
1000	1000	1	I am still laughing. This is what weaning off of Paxil and being a moron does to you.
1000	1000	1	08.26 day 14 rivaroxaban diary. Just been to cut some wild roses down so workmen can easily get to part of my garage. Intense back pain.
1000	1000	1	I've got a doctors appointment in a week. Will discuss adding low dose of antidepressant again...something not as "addictive" as Cymbalta...
1000	1000	1	@notquitereal yeah, I mean, fluoxetine made me feel like shit, and citalopram makes me feel ace, so worth considering if you ever have to
1000	1000	1	does trazodone actually make people feel like high omfg it makes me sleepy
1000	1000	1	Nicotine lozenges are giving me stomach cramps.
1000	1000	1	@LoveUsNotDrugUs many congratualtions for being able to come off quetiapine - I have read that and clozapine are the worst for withdrawals
1000	1000	1	The day after my humira jab and as ever i'm mega tired. May have to go back to bed.
1000	1000	1	Anyone have nerve damage symptoms (MS like) from Enbrel or humira? #rheum
1000	1000	1	@MisterAK47 @CBS I don't know what that has to do w/ me. Avelox has hurt my connective tissue,lungs and thyroid. I guess I should feel lucky
1000	1000	1	You don't know insomnia until you take 2 seroquel and work out at 3am.
1000	1000	1	@kitschmagnet I was on tysabri for 50 months. I'm in the process of going to tecfedera. It is similar, I needed to get off because of veins
1000	1000	1	@NewDay 'non hormonal treatment' for hot flashes not new; 10mg/Paxil(GSK), an SSRI now called 'Brisdelle'. SSRI Withdrawal Syndrome Alert!
1000	1000	1	Over-eaten AGAIN just before bed. Stuffed. Good chance I will choke on my own vomit during sleep. I blame #Olanzapine #timetochange #bipolar
1000	1000	1	the difference between 'just tired' and 'tired & in a fog' is amazing. so happy to be done taking levaquin, that stuff is way too strong
1000	1000	1	@craigsdaughter no joke! #tysabri worked like a charm for me, til my immune system went poof. hopeful about #Tecfidera :)
1000	1000	1	@DrOz i take Trazodone for my #insomina & still have a hard time falling asleep or I end up having crazy dreams that wake me up!?! #OzSleep
1000	1000	1	popped a Fluoxetine im sweating
1000	1000	1	YOU GUYS I WAS SUCKING ON THIS LOZENGE THATS SUPPOSED TO NUMB SORE THROATS AND NOW I CANT FEEL MY MOUTH
1000	1000	1	@andiedanley2626 cymbalta. 3x the dosage I was once on...everything is psychedelic and yuck. still grateful for meds!
1000	1000	1	Magically my appetite has gone back to normal since going off seroquel! Well, well, well - I was right, the doctor was wrong.
1000	1000	1	@Marcello I had to take Paroxetine tablets for a year nd a side effect is weight gain, it went to my core. Off them now bt can't shift it!
1000	1000	1	@uclaibd i never had bleeding or vomiting just alot alot of fatigue and face was pale and lost tons of weight.. #crohns #humira
1000	1000	1	So while I'm letting the thoughts of Lamictal/fatal rashes/tonsillectomy/spinal tap settle, I'm going to go rescue a budgie.
1000	1000	1	Coming off Cymbalta cold turkey.. day 4... I think I have vertigo! This is awful.
1000	1000	1	I'm having to pee way too much this drive.. Drinking too much water. Fuck you 70mg vyvanse and your ability to dehydrate the fuck out of me.
1000	1000	1	@Jules_Clarke banana? Hot milk? And randomly lettuce! All contain sleepy bye chems. All I have is trazodone which means dopey all day tomo
1000	1000	1	The Cipro in you eyes burns but works its buffered for your ears seems stupid but if they take your life take it back
1000	1000	1	@C4Dispatches I was prescribed Victoza for obesity in July 2010. I have been ill ever since. Evil drug #diabetes
1000	1000	1	Rocephin + Ciprofloxacin = me barely able to stay awake
1000	1000	1	Today I'm an emotional mess. That's what happens when I think I could wean myself off of Cymbalta.
1000	1000	1	#TwoThingsThatDontMixWell venlafaxine and alcohol- you'll cry and throw chairs at your mom's BBQ.
1000	1000	1	13.24 day 15 rivaroxaban diary. Atrocious backache despite having taken paracetamol an hour ago. Gone back to bed.
1000	1000	1	How do guys ejaculate on paxil?? #antidepressants

1000	1000	1	@SpooniesCouch @joodamsmith @seal_kim @sapril880 ant take anti seizure meds or anti depressants and cymbalta and Savella made me very sick:(
1000	1000	1	This quetiapine isn't working damnit!!!! Does make me hungry at night though... *sigh*
1000	1000	1	Conclusion: my psychiatrist is not very attentive and I should be on seroquel, not benzos and the maniatriggering lamitol. #ugh
1000	1000	1	I reaaaallly need to take my Paxil but it makes me feel so delirious and just messed up.
1000	1000	1	@GangamStyleDad is that like quetiapine. when i had to take that crap i could not stay up longer than 11 hours
1000	1000	1	okay i took the seroquel and i am resisting the urge to vomit it up i feel disgusting but oH WELL GOOD TIMES GOOD VIBES DON'T BE SAD
1000	1000	1	@OUCH_UK didnt know Lamotrigine was addictive Stopped as didnt think were helping @clusterheads 3 days of hell before realized, back on now
1000	1000	1	Playing league while on vyvanse is too damn stressful. Back to public I go!
1000	1000	1	I don't know whether my Vyvanse caused my caffeine addiction or caffeine caused my Vyvanse addiction.
1000	1000	1	@mizbergy that's the hardest part: difficult to willingly self-inflict pain. #Humira #rheum
1000	1000	1	@_cimmy_ thanks! yes, after I was prescribed Cipro a few years ago, and it REALLY messed me up, I am quite wary of broad spectrum ones.
1000	1000	1	Day 11 of #rwrunstreak completed. 1.32 miles of walking. Can't run even if I could because of Cipro. Also day 4 of mostly raw was good.
1000	1000	1	Restless Leg Syndrome is bad tonight. Damn you fluoxetine.
1000	1000	1	@DystoniaSociety I would like to know what everyone else's experience are of baclofen and clonazepam. Do they get dry nose / throat?
1000	1000	1	@whatkatie_did I'm certainly weird but it's quetiapine instead of crack, I can't get that on prescription.
1000	1000	1	Gotta find an alternative to Vyvanse, ASAP. I'd rather be sleepy & happy, than alert & depressed!
1000	1000	1	Day 4: The initial lamotrigine lethargy kicked in the day before exams. I tell myself that possible failure is better than possible death.
1000	1000	1	Have any of you developed knee pain since starting Tysabri ? What helps with the problem ?
1000	1000	1	@AquafarE The only things I know I'm allergic to are sulfa drugs and ciprofloxacin.

1000	1000	1	@DoctorChristian is my memory really bad due to 900mg seroquel and 120mg cymbalta or the bipolar itself? I'm not remembering conversations

1000	1000	1	@WarWraith I'm not even sure what to request. :/ Sertraline makes me sick now, Venlafaxine made me sick, Reboxetine and Citalopram useless
1000	1000	1	@TweetNomDePlume SSRIs were great for me for ages, not working as well now. Thus Seroquel. I’m also on Clonazepam, makes me sleepy too.

1000	1000	1	@Sectioned_ @bipolarlife7 @BBCWomansHour ah yes, I'm starting to think my paroxetine turns panic attacks into fat.
1000	1000	1	This higher dose of #cymbalta is making me extremely tired and anxious. Is this normal?
1000	1000	1	I don't know whether my Vyvanse caused my caffeine addiction or caffeine caused my Vyvanse addiction.
1000	1000	1	If this fuckin EMT looks at me one more time hes gonna feel the wrath of my vyvanse rage
1000	1000	1	@AnitaAlibi Paxil didn't end up helping. Tried Prozac and Wellbutrin and it helped my mood and anxiety but gave me vertigo. :(
1000	1000	1	My Effexor has left me with the inability to cry. I was dry eyed watching "Into the Wild" and even one of those Sarah Mclachlan commercials

1000	1000	1	I knew one day enbrel would b the death of me
1000	1000	1	Seroquel aka wake up at 2:30 and waste half your day sleeping.
1000	1000	1	I reckon I have drug-induced oedema causing musculo-skeletal pain. Likely drug combination: Rivaroxaban, Losartan, and Simvastatin.

1000	1000	1	@AshleyLVivian if #Avelox has HURT YOUR Liver, AVOID Tylenol ALWAYS, as it further damages LIVER, eat Grapefruit unless taking Cardiac drugs
1000	1000	1	@mikedelic if this is a real question, withdrawal from an antidepressant named Effexor was worse than cocaine withdrawal
1000	1000	1	Humira + thioguanine + preds = me have no immune lol.. Thankgod i on anti biotics for a bit... Then preds drop off #crohns
1000	1000	1	@charlienicola85 someones said can happen while fighting infection which is quite possible,nearly finished some cipro&bringing up foul gunk!

1000	1000	1	@fibrofighter08 Venlafaxine gave me horrendous nightmares, & coming of it was horrific.!
1000	1000	1	Oh hey. Much like other anti-convulsants, Lamictal dehydrates you. So much is explained.
1000	1000	1	seroquel is causing more gaps in memory, I don't remember going to therapy and as usual no one has stepped up to claim thos memories >>

1000	1000	1	Too tired to function right now, thanks Humira. #naptime
1000	1000	1	21.55 Rivaroxaban diary day 8. Aches easing, back pain easing. Swollen lower legs like fluid retention. I take 20mg. Furosemide every a.m.
1000	1000	1	@thebookgirl985 Trazodone makes me HUNGRY. Prop my eyelids open with toothpicks and drive me to a buffet?
1000	1000	1	I couldn't remember if I took a vyvanse or not early so I took another one &now I'm spazzing out... bc obviously I took one already #adhd
1000	1000	1	Levaquin sucks. Blinding headaches. Vomiting. Diarrhea. Time for my next dose. Happy weekend. #tmi #FML
1000	1000	1	When I had my infected K stone, hospital put me on Cipro - a synthetic antibiotic. I "smelled" a pungent solvent odor, I smell it now. Why?
1000	1000	1	@redbuttongirl I know. I just realised with everything else - I haven't taken the sodding quetiapine yet!! Wondered why I wasn't drowsy DOH!
1000	1000	1	great.. I have hives up and down my legs from this gosh dang trazodone
1000	1000	1	@CaroleWhelan I find the baclofen worse, it has left me in a tired/sleepy fog all day - the codeine I can (mostly) deal with.
1000	1000	1	@OisEucalypt I was on muscle relaxant Baclofen for two weeks, then 2 months trying to rid myself of it. 11 days in without and no sleep. :/
1000	1000	1	My mind races when I'm on a vyvanse
1000	1000	1	ciprofloxacin: how do you expect to sleep when your stomach is a cement mixer?
1000	1000	1	Zoloft was just as bad as Effexor. It made me more depressed and more suicidal. I don't want it.
1000	1000	1	Effexor XR side effects : - sucidal thoughts - insomnia - feeling high & unresponsible. -Dry mouth.
1000	1000	1	You know starting with geodon, the meds messed up my attitude. How odd. It's not just about spirituality. I became a bit mean. That got
1000	1000	1	@liver_bird_87 @MizTinkerbella when I was on cymbalta and visanne I could not orgasm at all!!!
1000	1000	1	I think that Vyvanse is making me grind my teeth...
1000	1000	1	personally I prefer staying up until I get hallucinations, to taking seroquel to get to sleep, but only because it's more fun for me
1000	1000	1	@MerePrototype Probably the combination with my fluoxetine. But I can't move that to night time, it makes me have bad dreams.
1000	1000	1	Paxil withdrawal is nasty. Do not like.
1000	1000	1	No pain is worse than Humira. Not even arthritis. Lmfao.
1000	1000	1	Holy shit balls pristiq withdrawals are very strong!
1000	1000	1	My choice was more #surgery on 6-ft small bowel or #Biologics like #Humira. Now #chemo is my only hope 2 treat #lung side effect. #Crohns
1000	1000	1	I'm void of nicotine and my moods are void of stability.
1000	1000	1	Do you know how badly I want a cigarette right now? But no. I manfully suffer through nicotine withdrawal—all for you #sacrifice
1000	1000	1	do i come off my medication or do i just continue to be a prozac zombie
1000	1000	1	Hey guys don't forget to refill your Paxil for like six days because the withdrawal is like heroin. Literally.
1000	1000	1	@MVRCIVL VYVANSE GOT ME UP LIKE ZOMBIES.. XAN'S PUT ME DOWN, THEM BITCHES CALL ME ROMNEY.. THE WAY I STEADY CLOWN #txfreestyle #barrdout
1000	1000	1	me : feeling fine, watching tv ... swiffer commercial #lamotrigine : Lol lets make the bitch cry at this... a fucking swiffer commercial.
1000	1000	1	Going off Paxil CR cold turkey is something you should never ever do if you value your brain cells.
1000	1000	1	Anyone taking lamotrigine suffer with headaches weeks after starting the med?
1000	1000	1	(cont'd) My pdoc altered the dosage of @Fluoxetine to 30mg. That's the only alteration. Because I complained about the extreme fatigue. :-(
1000	1000	1	Things which are the Spawn of Satin: mosquitoes, bananas, Facebook, Paxil withdrawal symptoms. #BewareOfSatin
1000	1000	1	@TheOnlyWayIsGay Fluoxetine. Killed my libido stone dead.
1000	1000	1	Fucking Effexor withdrawals. I would shake my fist but I don't have the energy.
1000	1000	1	@cheer_bear13 am on 300mg Quetiapine. Mainly tiredness it causes with me.
1000	1000	1	@epilepsysociety I have a Q..I am taking lamotrigine and wondered if anyone else has had insomnia as a side effect?and what to do about it
1000	1000	1	This seroquel is hitting me soo hard with this beer
1000	1000	1	@hello_nacho @tobiasampersand Lexapro gave me the worst mixed episodes. I have some instability with Pristiq but I can manage it ok.
1000	1000	1	-9.5lbs in 14 days. Obvious now that I should have stopped the quetiapine a long long time ago before I got in this state
1000	1000	1	#lamotrigine headaches suck :( i wanna curl up & cry.
1000	1000	1	Maybe cos of the insulin blocking effect of seroquel but I do feel sugar crashes when eat fast carbs. Will feel ill. So avoid where poss.
1000	1000	1	@Mannypresh602 word. I've been fuckin tweakin out on vyvanse and writing hella verses
1000	1000	1	@stavvers Yeah I hear epilim is pretty tough, sorry to hear re bad times with it :( Oddly, dear sweet Lamotrigine tipped me to a dark place
1000	1000	1	It feels like my brain is melting. 360mg of vyvanse in 24 hours... not smart danielle. not smart.
1000	1000	1	Vyvanse is a hell of a drug. You get expensive insomnia! And you get expensive insomnia!
1000	1000	1	@MagnoliaPearl Missing a day of meds is never fun. I get migraines if I don't get my Effexor. Do you just get super tired?
1000	1000	1	@renegade_snare @IBDTweet I feel your pain :( just got 1st #fistula URGH ! Humira worked for me for just 3months then got painful reactions
1000	1000	1	Seroquel left me with sleep paralysis. Abilify left me with occasional muscle spasms. I've been off of both for nearly a decade.
1000	1000	1	Ok brain & body. We need a chat about oversleeping and overeating since taking Olanzapine again #tuboficecream #timetochange #junkfood #gym
1000	1000	1	@levaquin Levaquin poisoned me and ruined my life! Constant pain 24/7! I hate you, Levaquin!
1000	1000	1	@jessicama20045 You know that Cipro is also made by Bayer, right? And it ALSO causes a horrific syndrome that mimics an auto-immune disease.
1000	1000	1	Day 6 cold turkey from Effexor. I believe this pic adequately represents my descent into madness. Or whatever.pic.twitter.com/Vz0oFABIA0
1000	1000	1	@remiamaka It wasn't an easy victory though. Felt like chemo with the Cipro. As for the heart, i meant for study purposes.
1000	1000	1	“@dipndots95: My vyvanse makes me nocturnal ”
1000	1000	1	Paroxetine, may make it hard to have an orgasm.
1000	1000	1	@thebeachynurse ...had to get an x-ray of my arm per protocol...it was negative but it's just now starting to hurt. Ugh!!!! #Geodon
1000	1000	1	@letti4u :( I'm sorry to hear that. I had a side effect from Humira that negated all TNF blockers so no Enbrel for me either. :( #rheum
1000	1000	1	@MissMazyGG anxiety has been so high. But yeah, if your dosage is high its hard to come off. I had to detox from pristiq (its cousin drug)
1000	1000	1	#cymbalta withdrawal has reached a peak, lost vision and almost crashed my car from a brain zap. thanks a zillion #elililly #bigpharma
1000	1000	1	@theJeremyVine I once had an allergic reaction to the anti-convulsant Lamotrigine. I got a rash all over my body that looked like burns.
1000	1000	1	@AmyBadkin @Kate24Hrs_aDay not to worry - just a bit of temporary fuzziness. I've been on Humira since 2007 & love it.
1000	1000	1	When the depression is coming out caused by this damn levofloxacin :))
1000	1000	1	Eurgh! Last time I was this tired, I was on a four day antidepressant cocktail binge. #seroxat #sertraline #fluoxitine #lithium
1000	1000	1	I really hate the fact that I feel like I need to throw up while at work. Maybe taking my vyvanse wasn't a good idea
1000	1000	1	Being sick every morning is getting really old. Not sure if anxiety or my body getting used to Paxil. Anyone know?
1000	1000	1	Your humira shot burns with the power of a thousand suns #IBDFMLMoments #Crohns #IBD #UC
1000	1000	1	Fuck Paxil. I never want to take this shit again, but every time I try I get ridiculously sick. My life suckssss.
1000	1000	1	So, I lasted 16 days on Seroquel. I couldn't handle the awful side effects. Constantly dizzy and lightheadeded & a myriad of other bad stuff
1000	1000	1	I hate how vyvanse makes me over think everything and it makes me angry about things that I shouldn't even be angry about
1000	1000	1	Meds paranoia cos my leg is itching #lamictal #bipolar
1000	1000	1	@Privacy625 @sandycolon25 what I take is SERIOUS. I never was informed ahead of time. I could get "metabolic" syndrome from Seroquel.
1000	1000	1	Found out that it could be two months before I sleep well again now that I'm off Seroquel. Srsly, fuck the psychiatrist that put me on it.
1000	1000	1	Plus this antibiotic is making me stupid and clumsy. Cipro is evil but the fever is gone.
1000	1000	1	Just took seroquel. Now I'm freaking out that I will end up sleeping 15 hrs and miss my 12pm appt tomorrow
1000	1000	1	@AgentMariaHill I've taken the BP daily if not twice a day like I should, it's juz I didn't think the Effexor would spike it so. I'm usually
1000	1000	1	@AuthorEdKurtz Oh, it sucks, but try doing SNRI withdrawal. They had to put me on a whole other drug just to get me off Effexor. :(
1000	1000	1	@Wee_Jendo Nicotine lozenges. If I go cold turkey I can’t think (or see) straight, so I can’t work.
1000	1000	1	@disabledmedic Quetiapine perhaps gives most dramatic effect for single low dose. No, pts are not being lazy in bed 20 hours a day, asleep!
1000	1000	1	I feel siiiiiiiiiiiiiiick. Damn you venlafaxine.
1000	1000	1	vyvanse makes me so fucking talkative I feEL LIKE A NORMAL PERSON
1000	1000	1	@ObsidianVormund @Glass1ncision sorry for jumping in. Trying to get up for work after night seroquel is a nightmare!
1000	1000	1	@rachelhatesjazz Watch your eyesight with Lamictal- I went from awesome vision, to wearing glasses full time for the 2 yrs I was on it.
1000	1000	1	Day 3 without #venlafaxine. Worst drug ever to withdraw from? Any support much appreciated!
1000	1000	1	For anxiety to penetrate through my drowsy haze (a result of the triumvirate of fluoxetine, pregabalin, amoxicillin?) is pretty good going.
1000	1000	1	@Azlemed first two weeks of olanzapine v drowsy. weight gain was an issue. Great for my anxiety though.
1000	1000	1	@aravain I've heard of all kinds of skin issues on Lamictal! pretty sure mine is psychosomatic though...
1000	1000	1	@arzbrocki Nawh Bactrim. Cipro made me sick once.
1000	1000	1	@bullfrogr @Soozmc123 amil isnt so bad, paxil makes everything slow and haldol is ok, and haldol .. i dunno how to explain what it does
1000	1000	1	@lotsOspermies well I’m taking it with a mood stabilizer (Lamictal). I can’t take anti-depressants by themselves-triggers my rapid cycling
1000	1000	1	But still Dr. Maria Jasinskas was right & would have been if not for Pharmacy; She said, "You know sometimes Vyvanse can make you depressed"
1000	1000	1	@Holeri81 Crippled since Oct of '09 thanks to just 12 Cipro pills here...run for your life! Tendon rupture is only the tip of the iceberg.
1000	1000	1	After taking olanzapine I wake up and feel like I am in a straight jacket because my muscles feel stiff
1000	1000	1	@RayvenMental Yeah the first time I was on olanzapine I did not put much weight on but 2nd time I did! Weird!
1000	1000	1	If this fuckin EMT looks at me one more time hes gonna feel the wrath of my vyvanse rage
1000	1000	1	Vyvanse masks me so depressed
1000	1000	1	@sickleSTRONG Word to the wise: Don't swallow Cipro AT ALL!!! It is POISON and can cripple you for life! Is your situation life or death?
1000	1000	1	Not to mention the thousands of people online who say they’ve stacked on the weight due to taking seroquel.
1000	1000	1	I have been on Seroquel (Quetiapine) for so long I don't even know what the side-effects are! Although, I think overheating is definitely 1.
1000	1000	1	@Bare_Faced_Chic I've had to reduce the quetiapine back to 400mg. Couldn't take the increased gastro pain. Was crumpled in a heap crying x
1000	1000	1	I need help Twitter. I was gradually coming off venlafaxine and now I'm completely off it I've been going though hell.
1000	1000	1	08.55 day 21 Rivaroxaban diary strange muscle spasms especially in neck shoulders and legs. No more fluid retention. More mobile.
1000	1000	1	@LISABROWNPHOTOS Consider yourself lucky if all it does is make you dizzy and sick! Cipro crippled me and countless others.
1000	1000	1	@KieraRampton It's called lamotrigine, I'm pretty sure the mix of them both is making me sick. I don't think bipolar & ADD mix very well..
1000	1000	1	"Prozac and Paxil have the same effects." WELL, SHIT. NO WONDER I FUCKING HAVE INSOMNIA AFTER I TOLD HIM I HAVE IT.
1000	1000	1	@darko_marco I've no probs with porn other than the fact that I've gained 80 pounds on Effexor and no one needs to see that ;-)
1000	1000	1	Cipro makes my nose feel like its bleeding. But it's not. #phantomsangre
1000	1000	1	I do wonder of that Achille's will ever recover fully from the Cipro.
1000	1000	1	EVERYONE: I HAVE A DRUG ADDICTION TO SEROQUEL, I TAKE 6 A YEAR, HELP ME STOP
1000	1000	1	@Dani_DeeH Nope, I tested positive for JCV. JCV & Tysabri = permanent brain damage or sudden death.
1000	1000	1	@cutefont I essentially felt nothing on them. Great for anxiety, bad for living. Coming off klonopin and paxil was hell though.
1000	1000	1	@MidwesternWife i feel your pain, im allergic to penicillin, ammoxicillin, levaquin, doxycycline. it sucks

1000	1000	1	I need to progress onto oxazepam.Apparently it's more sedating. Seroquel is sedating, but you can hardly open or close your mouth.
1000	1000	1	That zyprexa really makes your vocal chords marvelous only it makes you gain so much weight
1000	1000	1	Seroquel gives me nightmares every fucking night but I take it anyway
1000	1000	1	All I have to say is Cipro will mess you up kids. Don't get sick! #blagh #gross #weak
