I like the colour of Fluoxetine capsules.
@sargoldilocks ah nicotine lozenges got me off smoking. It broke the "cig in hand" habit, that's the worst part I found.

Cipro is poison and Big Pharma knows it
@willentrekin I had a physician comment it would be better for my seizures if I lived in a medical m. state instead of the lamictal.
@arioch1970 < Seroquel - at high doses its for psychotics at a low dose it helps anxiety, depression & insomnia. 25mg I can finally sleep.
treatment: 1) antibiotic therapy: cotrimazole, ciprofloxacin,cephalosporin,amoxycillin
@Anak_Bijak I see you talked about Latuda a while back. I just started on it last week. Has your experience with it been positive?

@MagriNick My epilepsy was lack of oxygen 2 my brain when i was born. U take alot of tabs like me then I take 18 never tried Vimpat though!
@FrancisWalter I hope that works. I found out Fosamax didn't help me on a DEXA scan, so was switched to Prolia injection twice a year.
@Manc_Lass I have a veritable cocktail! Naproxen 500, codeine phosphate 60, venlafaxine 150 daily and paracetamol 500 when needed! #druggie
My mind races so I have to have sumthin to slow it down before I hurt sumbdy or myself #Effexor

@ryanfarias24 they have .06 nicotine content and did u see the new jerseys ?
Humira is a bitch!! It better work on me!_
@chrisschnapp chemically, illnesses like these are of the brain itself. behavioral medication like zoloft, paxil, etc exist for this reason.

@BMcCarthy32 @Chipadelphia44 I was on Keppra but had trouble with side effects. I'm on Lamictal & Topamax now. Hope things work out Brandon.
@Geeky_Taurus Yeah, it's fairly new I think. After failing Enbrel and Humira, Rheumatologist though it was worth a shot.

@Fox1985 what u found out about cipro? Graeme always has dodgy bones x
@TweetyChatta that's good !!! Cymbalta helps with pain it's better than Zoloft ! Look up dairy it causes lots of issues in pain!
Is it hot in here or am I just depressed? FDA just approved an antidepressant--Paxil-- for hot flashes. See my story:http://www.latimes.com/news/science/sciencenow/la-sci-fda-antidepressant-hot-flashes-20130628,0,7638740.story …

@juzSilla depression hurts, you don't have to, Cymbalta can help....or at least that what my tv said
RTU pour le Baclofene! soon the sources of the full news... #baclofene #baclofen #alcoholism #alcoolisme
So based on the commercial I just watched, Cymbalta helps if it doesn't kill you first. Depression isn't the only thing that hurts.
I need a throat lozenge.
alright i have to get stuff done, work with me vyvanse

My doctor put me on Paxil, that's the same shit that's on tv for lawsuits so is it guna help me or kill me ?
@junespirit ok right now im on Paxil ive had Lexapro as well.. I go back to doc soon cause im not seeing and changes but happy for u!

@RMinNYC gotcha. I've tried so many meds over the past 16 years and the best one for me has been Paxil. I've been on it for at least 8 yrs
Congressman Peter King is well informed on the perils of ricin attacks...."Cipro isn't going to help you". OK Pete.... #GoodJobGoodEffort
While Paxil may be effective for its approved uses, side effects associated with the drug are often severe & potentially life threatening.
Ugh, throat really starting to hurt and I'm down to one lozenge.
Definitely not to me RT @UberFacts: Bananas contain a natural chemical that can make a person happy - The same chemical found in Prozac.
Exercising vigorously for 30-minutes three times a week is just as effective as Paxil and Zoloft in relieving symptoms of MAJOR depression.

And so it was decreed on this day in 2013, year of our lord that my first born shall be nameth Cymbalta.
Okay now this sucks cuz I don't feel like I can drive #trazodone
@dingo3pt0 there are some other ones. I take trazodone, but it's not a really common one. And work is part of it, but I've always had issues
I need a blunt.. but i'll settle for nicotine
Just sayin, there's a linear indirect relationship between the amount of weed I have and the amount of Prozac I need.

Why would you take your time to ask the GPS for directions and then not take them? #Xarelto
@Wolfrum <3 I took Paxil for several years. I had the same side effects. Good luck! :)
@Halfman_Imp I would share my Paxil with you any day of the week
How I know the Paxil is working: I insisted on taking the baby to the ER because I CARE ABOUT HIM, instead of letting my husband fix it.
You need vyvanse “@Eat_ah_Dick_ho: I'm so ADD it makes no sense smh”
I'm going to have to seriously look into a Vyvanse prescription since I won't be sleeping much this year.
Only the ACT can make a vyvanse feel like it has stop working after the 2nd section #brainsdead
Got some more fluoxetine pills though :)
@missdaisydip @Britni_Rose Abilify? No. Paroxetine is the first thing I've tried.
hmmm, I got a travel kit for my humira, with one ice pack, but this has two and is free.
Cymbalta is a pain reliever used to treat osteoarthritis? I thought it was an antidepressant. I'm so confused. My whole life has been a lie.

@Jonny_Wags @Hey_Jeffrey Wellbutrin did a pretty good job canceling out the side effects of Effexor back when I was on both.
Two patients died 3-4 days after injections with the long-acting antipsychotic drug #olanzapine #Zyprexa http://ow.ly/m9ZQu 
@lukeglaude Interesting read. Seeing an increase of use of Pradaxa in the CA market. Blood level monitored far less regularly than Coumadin.
going off of olanzapine is no picnic. you have to be prepared to ask the aid of the gods, Jesus, Krishna.
You can have all the papers, articles etc about #Pradaxa but until there is an antidote, this drug is a killer. #RECALLPRADAXA
@thatkatiegirl @meghugs This is why I'm glad I got switched to Vyvanse. They hardly ever run out of it.
"@UberFacts: Bananas contain a natural chemical that can make a person happy - The same chemical found in Prozac" @Jadolski I'll eat loads!!
@LooneyDem Yes, it is so frustrating. I'm already on the highest dose of Effexor and taking a relatively low dose of Lamictal.

Just sucked on a nicotine lozenge thinking it was a cough drop
@CarlySchlimps Not true AT ALL. It's just nicotine which there is barely any of it at all. SWERVE HOE.
@MaranaCzap look at the tweet near that one. I refuse to take that Seroquel XR anymore. It's bullshit

Checking out Cipro for the first time. The boys are behaving which helps! Good work @francaboutwine with the badlands ;-)

@MommySnarksALot The Zyprexa would be a good med to get on consistently. As an atypical anti-psychotic it's good for the manic type symptoms
@jessmiedema14 Maybe Cymbalta can help me.
